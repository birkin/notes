found this cool, both the good explanation, and the function and concept... I was reading some documentation on a feature of Zola (a static-site-generator) that auto-creates an elasticlunr search index, The docs note that though the index is auto-created, Zola doesn't supply any javascript to actually use it, but the docs show an example js file that uses the index.\nLooking at that example file, I was curious about what one function was doing...\nfunction debounce(func, wait) {\n  var timeout;\n\n  return function () {\n    var context = this;\n    var args = arguments;\n    clearTimeout(timeout);\n\n    timeout = setTimeout(function () {\n      timeout = null;\n      func.apply(context, args);\n    }, wait);\n  };\n}\n\n...and had chatgpt explain it. The main explanatory blurb:  \"The function provided is a common utility function called debounce. This function is used to limit the rate at which a function gets invoked. It's especially useful in scenarios where events might fire more frequently than you'd want, such as when resizing a window or detecting keystrokes in an input box.\"\n","id":"https://bspace.us/posts/debouncing-explained/","title":"debouncing explained"},"https://bspace.us/posts/moving-code-onto-network/":{"body":"In 2004, while in my masters program, deeply immersed in java object-oriented programming, I saw the potential benefits of code re-use that classes offer. I envisioned over time building up libraries of class-objects; by accessing them in future projects, I expected to be more and more productive.\nCode-reuse never quite worked out that way, though. What I've tended to do for new projects has been to copy a similar class from a previous project, paste it into the new project, weed out unnecessary attributes and methods, and add new code. In a way this makes sense: though I lose out on 'pure' code-reuse, I gain by having all code for a project together. That's nice for version-control and portability, and isolation of concerns in that I don't have to worry that a change in a class in one project will have unintended consequences in another project.\nBut reading a while back about service-oriented-architecture, and shortly thereafter having a need to code a couple of lines in python that I had just coded in php a day or two earlier -- the benefits of moving code into RESTful web-services, that is: moving it onto the network, became apparent.\nI do that all the time now. Just last week I had a need to convert between 10 and 13-digit isbns -- for the second time in a recent project, so rather than coding the conversion directly in the program at hand I put it into a webservice.\nIn this shift, I've finally realized that goal of code reuse, while still being able to maintain the version-control and isolation of concerns benefits of focusing on my specific project at hand.\nThe book 'RESTful Web Services' by Richardson and Ruby, while a bit dense, offers good insights on creating web-services (example: versioning). At some point, I'd like to come up with standards for Brown Library (and/or campus-wide) web-services. Examples: specifying versioning in the url, a documention url in the returned data, and a url in that documentation of all APIs/web-services the department offers.\nFor now, though, the simple shift toward moving code out of individual projects and onto the network has been rewarding.\n","id":"https://bspace.us/posts/moving-code-onto-network/","title":"moving code onto the network"},"https://bspace.us/posts/non-tesla-charging-challenges/":{"body":"Update: the gloom is lifting! Read why!\n\nI had a Chevy Bolt from 2018 through 2021 that I loved. It was a requirement of the lease that I had to return it at the end of the lease; I'd have bought it otherwise.\nDuring the time I had it, I took three very long trips (750-1,000 miles round-trip) to see what that was like. And I  took many other shorter long trips that required DC fast-charging (often referred to as \"level-3-charging\") --  as opposed to slower AC home-charging using the equivalent of an electric-dryer outlet (often referred to as \"level-2-charging\").\nThe Bolt is known to fast-charge very slowly. But it has great range, and is super-efficient (so it makes the most of every kilowatt it gets). I loved those trips. BUT... I went into those trips with a sense of adventure: I knew, from reading accounts of fast-charging non-Teslas, that I had to treat those trips like an airplane-pilot charting a trip. I had a backup-charging-plan, and at least some awareness of a back-up to the back-up plan. And I built-in lots of extra travel-time for possible charging issues. \nThere were often slower EV-Go fast-charging stations that were my back-up-plan to the main higher-speed Electrify-America (EA) fast-charging stations I usually used. At many EA stations, half the chargers wouldn't work at all, or would only work with multiple attempts. But that generally wasn't an issue, because there were rarely any other EVs there.\nNow, however, there are many terrific non-Teslas being sold -- the Ford Mustang Mach-E, the Ford Lightning pickup, the VW ID-4, and the Hyundai Ioniq-5 being a few -- but that means that the lack of EA reliability has become much more of an issue as more cars vie for working fast-chargers. Here's a recent youtube video that gives a sense of the kinds of charging issues that folk are experiencing.\nI replaced my Bolt with a Tesla Model 3. I love the car -- but there are definitely things about the Bolt that I miss. But Tesla fast-charging on long trips is unbelievably better. \nI can get in my Tesla, in Rhode Island, and push the voice-button and say \"Directions to Chicago\". The car knows how full my \"tank\" is, and routes me to a convenient fast-charging station on my way. As I get close, the car automatically prepares the battery to accept a fast-charge. The smallest charging-station I've ever seen had 8 chargers; most have a dozen or more. I pull up, unhook the charging-cable-plug, press a button on the plug that opens my car's charge-port, and plug it in. That's it[*]. It charges, fast. And most crucially, I simply don't have to even think about it not working (I think I've had only one or two times where I had to move over and use another cable, out of many hundreds of fast-charges). The importance of that reliability cannot be overstated: it is just not a concern. Contrast that experience with the youtube video above.\nMy EV evangelism is by no means Tesla specific. But I'm very sad to say that I can no longer recommend a non-Tesla EV to anyone if:\n\nit's going to be your only car, and...\nif you want to be able to even occasionally take long trips\n\n(If it's a second-car, or you'll just be using it for normal daily life, my all-brands EV evangelism stands. You charge at home, and start of each day with a full battery.)\nI just honestly wouldn't want my loved ones to have to go through the current all-too-common anxiety of getting a needed fast-charge along the highway in a non-Tesla. I really hope the current publicity around terrible charging experiences helps push companies to prioritize reliability. An increased number of chargers will address range-anxiety, but if they don't work reliably, real charging-anxiety and understandable frustration will result, harming EV-adoption.\nIn the future, I'm sure we'll look back on these days like the proverbial elders that talked of walking miles to school through snowstorms, but for now the hassles are real and terribly sad.\n\n[*] Re fast-charging, \"What about payment?\" you may wonder. The fast-chargers automatically use the credit-card associated with your car.\n","id":"https://bspace.us/posts/non-tesla-charging-challenges/","title":"non-Tesla charging challenges"},"https://bspace.us/posts/ok-again-to-buy-non-teslas/":{"body":"(Update: more automakers have announced they'll adopt NACS!)\n\nthe good news\nWith the announcement by General Motors this past Thursday that it will adopt the North American Charging Standard (NACS) fast-charger -- giving it access to many of Tesla's fast-chargers -- I can officially once again whole-heartedly evangelize non-Tesla EVs! (From Ford &amp; GM; Ford announced the same two weeks ago.)\nJust few months ago I had said I was terribly disappointed that I could no longer recommend buying a non-Tesla EV if...\n\nit was going to be one's only car, and... \none wanted to be able to even occasionally take long trips\n\nThe reason for my dampened non-Tesla EV enthusiasm was two-fold:\n\nThe non-Tesla fast-charging network, though slowly growing, has real reliability issues (link-1,  link-2). (This is in contrast to Tesla's fast-charging network, which is extremely reliable.)\nThe number of fantastic non-Tesla EVs has significantly increased, greatly exacerbating the frequency of terrible fast-charging experiences for non-Tesla EVs.\n\nbackground\nThe non-Tesla fast-charging system is comprised of a bunch of different companies not directly related to the main auto-companies. It uses a fast-charge plug and standard called CCS-1; Tesla's fast-charge plug and standard, NACS, is different. For a while, Tesla tried to get its fast-charger adopted to be a standard, but was unsuccessful. \nLast Fall Tesla released its fast-charger as an open standard -- with no takers. Though Tesla claimed it was open to other companies using its fast-chargers, most observers assessed that other auto-companies didn't want to be seen as in any way supporting upstart Tesla that has so disrupted the business-model of the traditional automakers. Second, many were suspicious that Tesla was serious. It's a huge competitive advantage for Tesla not to allow others to use its network. \nBut apparently Tesla was serious. Further, in addition to allowing Ford and GM to use its fast-chargers, it committed to fully opening its fast-charger-APIs to allow Ford and GM to completely integrate all fast-charger-availability and payment-processing through Ford's and GM's apps (not the Tesla app). Tesla fans aren't convinced that this is good for Tesla as a company, because even though Tesla will make money from charging for electricity, it'll completely lose a major competitive sales advantage (this post is an example of that). Still, the vast majority of Telsa fans are excited about this, because it will help advance EV adoption -- a core Tesla mission.\nAlready some of the big third-party charging companies have stated that they'll add NACS cables to their chargers. Most analysts believe it's just a matter of time before remaining auto-companies selling EVs in the U.S. make similar announcements. (Tesla makes up some two-thirds of the U.S. EV market; Tesla, Ford and GM together make up about three-fourths.)\nthe import\nThe reason this is so important is that Tesla's fast-charging stations are super-reliable. That means...\n\nfolk with non-Teslas will no longer have charging-anxiety on long trips\nnon-Tesla charging networks will have to dramatically improve their reliability once the non-Tesla owners see how reliable charging can be at the Tesla fast-charging stations\n\nThe wonderful icing on the cake is that the Tesla-NACS charger-plug is much, much better than the non-Tesla-CCS charger-plug. This is acknowledged even by folk who dislike Tesla. Look at this comparison-picture from the Electrek website. The NACS plug (in black) is smaller and significantly easier to handle, and the receiver port in the car works for both fast-charging and at-home-slow-charging.\nThis is a real win for consumers and for the adoption of EVs.\n","id":"https://bspace.us/posts/ok-again-to-buy-non-teslas/","title":"go forth and buy (some) non-tesla EVs!"},"https://bspace.us/posts/trying-to-speak-icelandic/":{"body":"I and a good friend recently travelled for a week in Iceland. The landscapes, glaciers, caves, natural hot-springs, and waterfalls that Iceland is known for were, truly, incredible. But some of my fondest memories were of my interactions with Icelanders while trying out my very limited Icelandic.\nI've travelled in Italy, and have experienced Italians welcoming, and warmly embracing, my attempts to speak Italian -- but the shock and happiness of Icelanders took me by surprise.\nI've wondered about this... I'd estimate that two-thirds of the folk we met in restaurants and hotels did not speak Icelandic. Most were in their twenties, from other parts of Europe and especially Eastern Europe, working in Iceland for the summer, and all spoke English.\nSo perhaps part of the warm reaction I experienced was due to the fact that during the summer tourist season, many Icelanders have the odd experience of going to many places in their country where they will only be understood if they speak English.\nBut it could also simply be that the 330,000 Icelanders know theirs is a small country, that their language (an ancient form of Danish, I'm told) isn't spoken elsewhere, and that it is, by many accounts, more difficult to learn than many other European languages which are spoken by more people over a wider geographical area. And so perhaps they were simply appreciative that an effort was made.\nRegardless of the reason, the surprise and warmth I experienced was moving. A few minutes after checking in (in English) to a hotel with a nice restaurant at the other end of the room, I went back to the front desk, paused, and said in English, \"I'd like to try my poor Icelandic.\" Then I said, in Icelandic, \"I'd like to eat, over there, at seven-o'clock. Is that ok?\" The attendant looked at me blankly, and I said, in Icelandic, \"I'm American; yes, my Icelandic isn't very good.\" He slowly shook his head, then started speaking rapid Icelandic that I couldn't understand -- which I told him, in Icelandic. He then told me, in English, that no, I had spoken perfectly, which was why he was so surprised. He then took me over to the bartender, and asked me to repeat what I'd said. The bartender, then, called over a waitress, and asked me to repeat what I'd said.\nGreat conversations ensued each time this happened. And even when my attempts at Icelandic failed with the summer European workers, talking with them about their language experience was fascinating. I asked some of the Eastern Europeans: If they were to run into someone from another Eastern European country -- would their common language tend to be Russian? They said no, that for some folk in their parents' generation that would've been true, but all the young people spoke English. In fact, two different twenty-something Eastern Europeans said that growing up, they learn a dialect if from a small village -- and both their country's language and English -- and then for a foreign language they'll most commonly learn French or German or Russian. That's right -- that phrasing of English not being included in the listing of foreign languages is accurate.\nI'm cutting this post off here -- I've written more, about how I don't think of myself as very good at languages, despite what the above may imply. But I'll put those thoughts about learning languages in another post. To finish here, I'll just suggest that if you have even a passing interest in languages, and have a foreign trip coming up, take a stab at learning a bit of the language of the country you're visiting. Trying to do that stretches the mind; you're confronted with little conceptual shifts and subtle differences in thinking. For instance, in Icelandic, the shift from \"restaurant\" to \"the restaurant\" doesn't add another word, like in English or French or Spanish or Italian -- the word \"restaurant\" itself changes. Many of these shifts and mental challenges you'll feel but not understand. But that's ok -- that's exactly the attitude that can make your traveling experience richer and more rewarding.\n","id":"https://bspace.us/posts/trying-to-speak-icelandic/","title":"trying to speak icelandic"},"https://bspace.us/posts/user-context/":{"body":"I recently organized a meeting to brainstorm about what kinds of cool library things we could do if we knew more about a user's context. I also put up a wiki-page for the brainstorming process.\nThis stems from a requirement for a project: I had to be able to access a particular barcode related to a user. Turned out the only way of getting at this barcode was to first get another piece of information, and then use that first piece of information to call an API that returns a bunch of info about a user, including the barcode. Fine; did that; got the barcode and used it for a tunneler I built. I then went to the Access 2007 conference, a wonderful library programming/technology conference, where, among other terrific presentations, I heard Mark Leggot speak[*] about the repository presentation-PDF he set up at the University of Prince Edward Island (UPEI). He mentioned the importance of understanding a user's 'context'. Something clicked, and the general implications of what our team had achieved by being able to tie a user's log-in to this API-info about the user became clear.\nThis is nothing new in the internet business world; Amazon has been trailblazing this path for years. But given that authentication has mostly been a simple 'boolean' system in our Library webapps of just determining whether or not a user is permitted to access a site -- this opens up worlds of exciting possibilities. Already we've implemented a proof-of-concept 'drop box' that determines, from login, the user's 'type' (faculty/staff/student) and department and uses this data to customize the page displayed after login. Exciting stuff!\n\nNotes...\n[*] The video of Mark Leggot's presentation is no longer available; the reference was: http://video.google.ca/videoplay?docid=6976320823933843470&amp;hl=en-CA\n","id":"https://bspace.us/posts/user-context/","title":"user-context"},"https://bspace.us/posts/vendor-api-manifesto/":{"body":"(I wrote this early in the Fall of 2007 and circulated it to folk in the Library who were attending meetings at which vendors were advertising their wares.) \n\nSoftware products are created, understandably, primarily to meet existing needs. There are varied bodies of thought as to how much a software product should be designed to meet 'future possible needs'.\nAt certain points in recent history, it may have been reasonable to design the sole interface to a system assuming that the user of the interface would be a person using a web-browser.\nThough APIs (application programming interface) have been around for ages, the trend toward programmers wanting to access internal and external systems via APIs has accelerated tremendously over the last few years.[*] As a programmer for a creative web-services department in a creative Library, I'm part of this trend. Our team's need to be able to programmatically access systems has increased dramatically. Fortunately, a few vendors such as Ex Libris understand this and have built possibilities for programmatic access into their products. But many closed systems remain.\nTo managers and directors making purchasing decisions, I urge that a top-level purchasing consideration be whether the vendor's product offers an API to the information it provides (in addition to any built-in web interface). The simple reason is that a web presentation of information is designed for a single purpose: for a user to interact with the system via a browser. An API allows the system's data to be accessed in any way we see fit, now or in the future.\nA concrete example for any reader not familiar with the notion of an API...\nOur team is currently developing a system to simplify the process of obtaining a book through interlibrary-loan services. In order to do this we have been able to automate the process of searching a consortial web-catalog for an item, and requesting that item. But the only method of doing this involves creating a program which essentially mimics a browser, automatically simulating clicked buttons and links and reading the resulting HTML of the consortial catalog's web interface.\nThis works, but is terribly fragile: if the design of a web-page changes, our program may no longer work until it is reconfigured to understand the new design.\nWhat we absolutely need (in addition to the existing web interface) is a catalog-service (the API) which would allow a defined http request to be sent to a URL that will allow a search to be performed, or an item to be requested, etc. (That http request would come from a program our team has written -- instead of from a user sitting at a browser.) Each request to this API would return predictable documented structured information (XML is one standard; there are others). Our team's program would then be able to automatically process this information.\nIt is worth emphasizing that I am not asking for a 'whole new program' from the catalog vendor. A system's existing internal program logic that produces the information for the regular web data-stream is applicable to production of the alternate API data-stream. Yes, it takes thought and work to create a good and secure API and document it -- but an API, essentially, presents the same data as a web interface, in a simpler format. The mind-shift in offering an API is often larger than the work-shift.\nFinally, about interacting with vendors regarding this issue... Vendor sales people aren't the developers, and it sounds like I am asking for something that vendor developers would be more knowledgeable about. But I've seen different vendor sales representatives at workshops and conferences, and the representatives for products that provide APIs have universally very clearly understood the importance of this issue. Thus if a product representative does not seem to understand this important feature, I would have significant concerns with the product.\n\nNotes...\n[*] Key aspects of this trend are articulated in the seminal article \"What Is Web 2.0 --\nDesign Patterns and Business Models for the Next Generation of Software\" by Tim O'Reilly.\n","id":"https://bspace.us/posts/vendor-api-manifesto/","title":"Vendor API Manifesto"},"https://bspace.us/posts/weighted-randomization/":{"body":"Many years ago one of my children hit a wall with Math in elementary school. He had always been bright, and quick to pick things up, so this was something of a surprise to him as well as to me. His class was in the early stages of learning multiplication, and it turned out that he had initially been able to add numbers in his head quickly enough that he hadn't needed to memorize the times-tables. This worked fine for him with lower numbers like 5x2, but began to break down pretty quickly with higher numbers like 9x7 and especially 23x76.\nFlashcard app\nSo I ended up doing something I had sworn I'd never do: I created a flashcard program on the computer to help him memorize his basic times-tables. I had always thought that using computer programs for rote memorization was a travesty -- knowing that computers could be used for interesting and mind-expanding purposes rather than boring, mind-numbing ones. But this became a fascinating project. I started out implementing it in FileMaker Pro, which I had begun using extensively for some database projects, and eventually reimplemented the program in REALbasic, a wonderful program (at least at the time; I haven't used it in years) that introduced me to object-oriented programming, and through the sheer elegance of its interface and structure nurtured my growing sense that programming was about Art in addition to Logic.\nIn addition to wanting to present a nice interface, I also knew that I wanted the questions presented to my son to flow in such a way that he would be quizzed more often on the questions he answered incorrectly, and less often on the ones he answered correctly. In any given work-session, I also wanted him to be able to work with a narrow slice of the whole set of 'difficult' problems so that he would perceive some sense of gaining mastery over material.\nTo clarify this last point, imagine a problem set of 10,000 questions, 5,000 of which are very easy, and 5,000 of which are very hard. Imagine you sit down to a 10-minute 'memorization-session'. If the program utilizes a very simple algorithm which chooses randomly from among the 5,000 difficult questions, chances are that after the 10 minutes you will have learned nothing and will be quite discouraged: you'll likely not have seen the same question twice, and you'll have answered everything wrong. This would be bad enough if you were an adult committed to learning the material, but if you were a kid in elementary school, this would be likely to crush any flickering desire to learn the material.\nAnd I wanted my program to be fun.\nDetails\nMy solution was to use what I call 'weighted-randomization'. Sometime I'll do a thorough search for the files I used those many years ago to see if I can find the code I created -- for posterity, amusement, and fond reflection. The basic idea consisted of two steps. First, from among all the... I guess 169 possible times-table queries (0x0 through 12x12), I chose a small subset: 10 as I recall, although eventually I made this number selectable via a preferences-pane (remember, I made this for a young kid, and assumed two 5-minute practice-sessions a day -- the latter one being optional but often completed because the app was fun). Second, I presented the queries. But of course the joy was in the details.\nFor the selection-step, my recollection is that I iterated through each possibility, and assigned it a 'selection-number', then sorted the list on selection-number and took the top 10. Before I describe the selection-number, I must first note that each possible query was initially assigned a 'score' of 0. When a query was answered correctly, the score was incremented; when answered incorrectly, the score was decremented. I eventually put the increment and decrement values into the app's preferences-pane to play around with their effect on the operation of the application, and as I recall usually had them set to increment correct answers by 1, and decrement incorrect answers by 2.\nSo why the selection-number rigamarole? Why not just sort on score, and take the 10 lowest numbers? That certainly would achieve the goal of presenting the user with the most-problematic problem-set. I did do that initially, but added the selection-number for two reasons. First, the simple presentation of only the hardest problems felt, well... boring. Second, I thought if I occasionally threw in some problems 'mostly' known, I would encourage crucial reinforcement to take place. And if one or two of the problem-set were 'easy', well, those queries' scores would rapidly increase and be less likely to be selected as part of the subset next time. Thus the selection-number. I don't remember the exact details, which I changed and experimented with extensively, but the basic idea: I took the lowest-score and the highest score, and split the range between them into, say, 10 equal segments. I then iterated through the queryset. For each score, I determined the segment it belonged to, then created a certain number of random-numbers, took the highest one, and assigned that as the selection-number. A more specific concrete example... Say the lowest score was -25 and the highest score was 5. That's a difference of 30. Splitting that into 10 segment-ranges yields segment ranges of 3 values. Thus the bottom segment-range would be -25 through -23, while the top segment would be 3 through 5. During the iteration step, if I came across -23 (in selection-range '10'), I would create '10' random numbers, and the highest one would become that query's selection-number. If I came across '3' (in selection-range '1'), I would create '1' random number; it would become that query's selection-number. Thus sorting then on selection-number and choosing the ten highest numbers would usually offer a subset of all queries consisting of mostly the hardest queries, mixed with some somewhat-hard queries, with an occasional easy query thrown in. Beautiful. Again, I don't remember the specific details, and do remember that I played frequently with the number of ranges and the number of random-numbers assigned for each range, but this description reflects the general approach to the slice-selection step.\nThe program was a hit, and did exactly what I had hoped, helped my child memorize his times-tables. Shortly after I built it, I was immersed in learning Italian, and realized that with just a few tweaks this would be a terrific tool to help me memorize vocabulary. That also worked well, especially the ability to focus a review-sesion on a subset of all the words, because I built up a vocabulary set of hundreds of words. But abstracted from the tool, I kept ruminating on what made 'weighted-randomization' so compelling.\nThe idea\nThe concept binds together polar notions in a way that feels 'right'. Variety, as we've all heard, is the spice of life; morphing random-chance into likelihood offers possibilities for combining intentionality with variability to create joyful experience, as any gamer knows. The game Dungeons &amp; Dragons wonderfully codified realms of probability in spirals of detail useful to both the casual gamer and the addict: a strong character will be more 'likely' to defeat a weaker character, but more granularly, a particular delivery of a particular blow will be more or less likely to be successful based on the quality of the attacking weapon and the defending shield, the skill of the attacker and defender, etc. The varied dice used to calculate these percentages seem themselves talismans. But on a simpler level, any player of Risk or Backgammon perceives these same issues. The roll of the dice is pure chance, but the strength of ones position makes the outcome of a battle or game dependent on the same order-and-chance qualities embodied in weighted-randomization.\nMaking the world a better place\nI find it interesting to think about applying randomization to other systems. \nLifeBalance is a wonderful little to-do list program I miss using since I gave up my Palm for an iPhone. I don't have direct knowledge of its internals, but I suspect it incorporates weighted-randomization in it's preparation of one's task-list. One part of the program offers the ability to define broad areas of life (i.e. work, maintaining friendships, family-life, etc.) and assign a rough percentage of time one would ideally like to devote to each area. Since to-do tasks end up being subsets of these areas, and since each task can be assigned a rough amount of time it will take to accomplish, the program tracks how much time is actually being expended in the broad areas, and optionally adjusts the current to-do list to maintain the preferred balance. The result is that there may be occasions in which a task of a slightly lower priority can appear higher on a to-do list than a task with a higher priority, if the lower-priority task will better-serve the less-immediate goal of achieving the life-area balance specified. This approach could conceivably be implemented using algorithms that don't utilize weighted-randomization, but this is just the kind of situation that weighted-randomization would be good for -- injecting a bit of flexibility into a system while still maintaining overall goals.\nAs a final thought experiment, imagine possibilities for injecting weighted-randomization into political systems.\nI have a vague memory from a college class, likely jumbled by time, of hearing that in 15th Florence, a cohort of possible city-council leaders was chosen from among the populace much like those chosen for jury-duty today. As I recall, each individual in the cohort was then voted on by the populace, but only whether the individual was fit to serve: a yes or no vote. If a person received enough yes-votes, his name was put into a hat from which the new leaders were drawn at random. This unusual form of weighted-randomization suggests that when injected into political systems, it might reduce corrupting influences and by inference improve quality. Usually, and reasonably, years-of-service or merit-evaluations or test-scores are the institutional barriers to corruption. Weighted-randomization could be another tool worth exploring.\nImagine that of all bills a legislative committee debates publicly, 80% are selected for debate according to usual political processes, and 20% via a weighted-randomization scheme akin to my math flash-card program (i.e., perhaps a manual ranking of preference followed by randomizations based on those rankings). Obviously no one would want chance to factor into whether a bill actually becomes law, but since so many good ideas die for want of being scheduled for committee debate (often for questionable political reasons), injecting a bit of weighted-randomization into such a process could be a good thing, certainly worth trying.\nI may add to this post other realms in which weighted-randomization might offer systemic improvements. Feel free to suggest ideas; I may post a few of them here.\n","id":"https://bspace.us/posts/weighted-randomization/","title":"weighted randomization"},"https://bspace.us/posts/youth-and-library-technology/":{"body":"In late September I saw an announcement about a computer science talk which referred to an acronym I wasn’t familiar with: CS4RI. A bit of googling led to the organization 'CS4RI: Computer Science for Rhode Island'. Its website included a link to their 'CS4RI Summit 2016', which stated as a goal: \"The CS4RI Summit aims to inspire the next generation of computer scientists, entrepreneurs, and engaged tech sector employees… let’s excite students with the many educational and career opportunities that result from studying CS…\"\nOur Digital Technologes department is a vibrant place to work.
