And the most direct way to do that for parsing is to pass in source-data, and specify a clear assertion. \nsimple and direct\nI began that way: \nHere's the beginning of Parser testing.\nHere's the first iteration of parsing a patron note -- although the test was originally called, simply test_parse_patron_note().\nThat happened to be for a physical item; shortly thereafter I needed to parse the note for a digital item. Here is the iteration that tested for that. \nImplementing that second test, I renamed the first example to show that the test was for a physical item, and named the second test to show that it was testing a digital item. I could have passed just the specific item-xml or item-xml-object to each test. In some ways that would have been simpler and \"purer\". But the real data for this project comes in a file containing multiple kinds of items, and I was going to be using the items for different kinds of tests (not just notes), so I figured I'd have one main test-file that would contain a variety of items to use for the tests. (Though this does add a slight dependency to the test -- file loading -- and dependences are frowned upon.)\nIn the two examples shown so far, I chose, from the source-data being tested, the first list item for the physical-note test, and the sixth list item for the digital-note test.\nThis is all reasonably forthright. The nice thing about this is that, coming back to this code in future weeks or months, and running the tests, I'd see from the terminal output, when running the test-suite, the explicit test_parse_patron_note_physical() and test_parse_patron_note_digital() tests. That's really useful when revisiting code.\nBut the more edge-cases that arise, the benefits of this explicitness quickly, for me, feel outweighed by the duplication. I could have half-a-dozen explicit tests for parsing just the notes field for physical items, another half-dozen for digital items, and have lots of very specific tests for all the other parsing.\nscalable\nIn this and other projects, in this situation, I've moved to a different pattern: a single test for parsing the target field (in this case the note). This single test first loads up an array of items, an array of expectations, and then iterates through the array, so the single test in this case is actually testing eight variations.\nThis has some real advantages -- it's very scalable, since adding a new source-data item simply involves adding an expectation to this note, and the other parsed fields. I might be adding the new item because I'm aware of an edge-case for parsing, say, the item-barcode, and by having to also list the note expectation, I might end up catching some error I hadn't been aware of.\nBUT... there is loss with the gain. I need to view the comments (or the source-data) to see/remember that I'm parsing physical vs digital items. (Might there be another digital item that I forgot to indicate via a comment?) And I'm not going to see those comments in the test-output. \nI just remembered long ago implementing something like this with an additional field in the array. Instead of just handing two-elements in each loop iteration (the source-item-data, and the expectation) -- I also had a comment that was printed, too. That would restore some of the useful specificity of output -- and on a failure, allow me to target, more quickly, the location of the error.\nThis example of gain/loss refactoring is a miniscule one -- but it reveals aspects of the decision-making in programming that I love.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/art-of-testing/","title":"approaches to testing"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/benign-neglect-opportunities/":{"body":"Cathy Marshall of Microsoft Research gave a keynote at the wonderful code4lib 2010 conference that provided a useful nudge to my thinking about repository layers.\nI've suggested elsewhere that university libraries contemplating a repository should consider developing policies around repository 'layers'. This notion involves both an inner long-term, high-guarantee archival layer -- and an outer services-oriented work-space layer. Reasons for the archival layer are obvious. Perhaps less so are reasons for and benefits of the work-space layer: it fulfills a library mission to further scholarly work; it strengthens the library's position as a central part of the academic campus community; it creates opportunities for valuable work to be moved easily into the archival layer.\nThough my Library doesn't conceptualize our repository in this way, it's compelling enough that I think about this layered approach regularly. Given some exciting video initiatives at my University, much of my recent work-space layer thinking has focused on how to avoid the possibility of having precious library disk space overwhelmed with hypothetical services-layer low(er) quality materials. Strategies I've considered to deal with this concern are combinations of limiting the size of an entity's (person/department) work-space, and/or limiting the number of years items may remain in the work-space. Given my strong belief in providing useful and friendly user-services, in this 'limiting' scenario, we would provide terrific charts and notifications which would allow work-space users to easily monitor their usage of this temporal, useful space -- and provide tools and Library staff assistance to easily move appropriate items into the archival layer.\nBut regardless of the intention to have this work-space be used productively, there would be a high likelihood that the more control we give users over their Library work-space, the more likely that a significant portion of this work-space would fill up with materials that exist simply because it's more of a hassle to delete things than it is to neglect them -- one of Marshall's key points.\nWhile Marshall specifically noted the problems of benign-neglect as a user-strategy for handling materials, she also noted that benign neglect offers opportunities. This was the nudge. I'm finding this notion of opportunities fascinating to reflect upon; it offers new realms for thinking about interesting services that could be built for this work-space layer.\nThe simple accretion of data from benign neglect suggests the now-common mining strategy associated with usage-data, popularized by amazon: \"you may also be interested in this\". A colleague recently told me about 'mallet', software than can mine texts to discern topics. It would be a worthy experiment to use such a tool to offer repository users an optional discovery service based on their text-based work-space materials.\nTwo additions to Apple's iPhoto application in the last year or so suggest other possibilities. 'Faces' scans a user's iPhoto library, using pattern-recognition routines to create groupings of people. 'Places' scan's the library and extracts geo-location coordinates if available, and, if I recall correctly, timestamp data, to create a map view over time of photo-locations.\nOther scans could be run on work-space data, looking for patterns of government data-sets or citations. And combinations of embedded metadata such as geo-location and mime-type and date could be gathered, so that if, for example, a pattern of images taken at a certain location on a certain date was detected, not only could auto-grouping of those items be presented, but external sources such as flickr could be queried as well, offering the user the ability to see other external views of this 'event'.\nMany of these scan/mining ideas would also be useful to apply to the repository as a whole. Such scans could offer both automated randomized general-discovery displays, as well as offer researchers additional focused discovery-views to permitted items. But to the extent that such services enhance the quality of users' work-space experience, it might help to keep the materials in the work-space more relevant: using benign-neglect to minimize benign-neglect.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/benign-neglect-opportunities/","title":"opportunites of benign-neglect"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/birth-tips/":{"body":"That title sounds a bit odd, doesn't it.  🙂 \nAs a father of two, I've had occasion, over the years, to offer my 'three tips' to first-time moms-to-be, and have received positive feedback. Recently I've been thinking about birth due to recent family and friend births, and figured I'd write them up...\nChildbirth classes\nThink of tips &amp; techniques as tools, not rules.\nI highly recommend childbirth classes; I really cannot say enough positive things about them -- even refresher ones. However, my advice for moms (and partners): view the tips and techniques taught as 'possible tools', not 'rules to live up to'. Specific moms may or may not find specific tips and techniques useful. The reason I note this is because I've occasionally talked to moms who have been disappointed with their 'performance' during birth -- often because they had an expectation from a class of how the birth 'should have' progressed. One mom told me she was embarrassed at how loud she was, thinking that if she would have performed the class' breathing and relaxation techniques 'better', she wouldn't have needed to yell. My thought: if yelling or grunting works for a particular woman -- that is fine, whether or not it is in any standard technique playbook.\nVisitors\nPick a close friend or family member to not visit until after four weeks have elapsed.\nThis is mostly for the first kid. It comes from a midwife, and was dramatically confirmed by our experience with our firstborn. She told us that after the child is born, friends and family will, understandably, want to come and visit and help out. By the time a month has elapsed, everyone has come and gone, and that is when the effects of sleeplessness can become more pronounced, and help is most appreciated/needed. Based on this, we planned to have one of our good friends fly in around five weeks after the birth of our first child. Our baby was colicky until about six weeks, and our friend's simple willingness to do laundry, to organize pizza deliveries, and to simply watch the baby while we both took a short walk was deeply, deeply appreciated.\nBreastfeeding\nIt's not innate! Learn, and ask for advice.\nI suspect that in times when multiple generations of families commonly lived together, or for those women who have had a baby after a bunch of their women friends have, this fact would not be the surprise that it was to us. However, we were among the first of our set of friends to have children, and so hadn't had the experience of extensive conversations.\nI had naively assumed that breastfeeding would be some sort of natural, somewhat instinctive process, but our midwife encouraged us to go to a breastfeeding class. The instructor basically noted that given that our society is no longer made up of multi-generational families living together, many are not aware that the process can be difficult for mom and baby to get used to. In particular, she noted that because first-time moms are understandably concerned about the baby, that it's easy for an unconstructive cycle to quickly develop: mom is worried that baby isn't getting enough milk -&gt; feedings thus become more stressful -&gt; feedings thus become more difficult -&gt; mom worries more. The instructor showed the (clothed) moms helpful holding techniques, gave information about dealing with sore nipples (and noted how commonly that condition occurs among first-time moms especially), and gave a hotline number for information and support and even a home-visit for a bit of coaching. For us, breastfeeding mostly went smoothly for mom &amp; baby, but during a few difficult periods, the information and the normalization of the problem from that class was invaluable. (I trust that it's not even necessary here to spend any time noting why breastfeeding is a Good Thing.)\nBy the time we had our second baby a few years later, I noticed, in our brief hospital stay, much more information being offered about breastfeeding tips and techniques. I hope information this trend has continued.

That's partly for the purpose of making code-reuse a reality but even more-so for the purpose of making possible new and interesting uses of data.\nAt the Library, we've truly moved into the realm of moving code onto the network. The web-services we've created have, not surprisingly, been library-related:\n\nAn isbn converter.\nA 'cleaner' for data output from an ILS API.\nMany 'tunnelers' into consortial borrowing services returning results of searches, with the order number, if applicable.\nA reprocessor of OCLC xISBN data that returns a only those OCLC xISBNS that have the same format and are in the same language as the submitted ISBN.\nAn OCLC to ISBN converter that will take an OCLC number and see if there are versions of that item available with ISBNs.\nAn OPAC status &amp; location checker.\netc. etc. etc.\n\nI've wondered recently what APIs the library could offer that would be of value campus-wide. More specifically, what APIs we might develop for our own needs that would be useful to the campus as a whole. Of course, many of our APIs do currently benefit the wider campus community in that students, staff, and faculty across campus use services of ours that are made possible via our behind-the-scenes use of APIs. I'm thinking more of APIs that developers in other departments might find directly useful.\nWhen considering APIs that would be useful for developers across the campus, I naturally think of our Computing and Information Services department (CIS). I've had good conversations, and hope to have many more in the future, with CIS folk about having them develop and evangelize campus-wide APIs. My thinking has been that over time, developing such APIs could save them an enormous amount of time as well as enhance good will from departmental developers.\nAn example: for one of our Library projects, we need a listing of faculty and course information. I'm not directly involved in this project, but my understanding is that we periodically request a list of faculty and courses from CIS; they produce the list; and we update some db tables for web-apps that make use of this information. My sense is that if certain Banner APIs could be enabled -- obviously with appropriate security implemented -- we could get this information directly from a feed / API call, simplifying our workflow and lightening the workflow of the CIS folk who produce the list for us.\nI'm encouraged from my conversations that there are folk in CIS who share this perspective and are working to realize it. While good discussions and planning proceed, I find myself gravitating to what we in the Library could do now along these lines. Three ideas...\nCafeteria menu\nAs part of an idea that deserves its own post (the idea sounds a bit silly without context, but indulge me), I've thought that it would be very useful on a particular Library web page to be able to display the next upcoming meal at the main campus cafeterias. I spent about ten minutes exploring the availability of that information, and found two web-pages and a downloadable excel spreadsheet. None of these are ideal sources of information to automate, but it could be done, and I wouldn't be at all surprised if the resulting structured feed would be of use to others, from individual students to the campus newspaper.\nSafeRide arrival time\nWe have a campus shuttle system comprised of about seven vans. A couple of these have GPS receivers, and a vendor website displays on a map (map was linked; but no longer available), via quite gnarly javascript, the current location of the GPS-enabled vans. That's nice, but the experience could be significantly improved. \nI've thought it would be extremely useful to be able to display on a Library web-page (if the student is accessing the page from within the Library) a simple line like \"The next SafeRide shuttle should arrive here in about 10 minutes.\" Simple and seriously, wonderfully useful information, that doesn't get in the way of the task at hand. That same Library web-page, if accessed from outside of the Library, simply wouldn't have that line displayed.\nThe API we could create, from parsing the javascript on the vendor web-page, could most simply at a minimum return location information for the GPS-enabled shuttles, which could be interpreted by our own server-side logic to approximate arrival times. But even better, the logic of determining arrival times could be embedded in the API itself. The API could take a location-parameter and return expected arrival time for the submitted location. We at the library might only implement logic that focuses on the arrival times at the Library. But by opening up the arrival-assessment code, we could allow BioMed developers to add to add arrival-time logic for shuttle-stop-locations close to BioMed buildings, and students to add arrival-time logic for shuttle-stop-locations close to particular dorms.\nSince developers can determine the IP address of an incoming request for information, and since developers and computer-knowledgeable students know the IP-address ranges of buildings in their purview, we really can do this.\nPublic computer availability\nImagine you're a student. You need to get some good work done and know if you stay in your dorm room this evening you won't get that work done -- there are just too many distractions. So you want to go to the Library. You have a desktop computer, or maybe just don't feel like lugging your laptop in the rain, and you know the Libraries have public clusters. Problem is -- it's getting close to midterms and sometimes the clusters get pretty full. Wouldn't it be great, I mean, really, really great, to be able to access a web-page that shows public cluster availability across campus?\nI've talked with some CIS folk about this and found individuals who are working hard to realize this goal. They do have software that can detect the 'in-use' status of each terminal in the clusters, and last I checked (in November, I think) had noted that the software had upgraded its web-display capability which with they were experimenting. However, the public web display of cluster availability is as of this writing only accessible... from cluster machines. But the hope is that this information will eventually be made more public. That's great, but I'd like to take the data a step further, and create an API to the data. The reason is that if the data were also exposed via an API in addition to a web-page, I could solve more specific problems in a targeted way. For instance, one of our Libraries has 15 floors, with public computers available on multiple floors. Wouldn't it be terrific if a student entering that Library could glance at a display screen and see the relevant computer availability (with floor numbers listed instead of generic cluster IDs) for just that building? An API would allow that.\nI have other ideas as well, but this gives a good flavor of how in the future, as we meet Library needs, we might be able to offer very useful API data to developers across campus.\n\nTo close, an exhortation... In each of these three situations, I speak of creating an API from existing publicly available electronic data. My excitement about creating and then utilizing these APIs for user-services is evident. But really, I should not have to create the APIs; I should be able to spend my time building the useful services for the Library and our campus that the APIs allow. So to all: if you know anyone creating any web-information -- encourage that person to expose their data not only via a 'regular' web-page, but also in a predictable structured way that can make its re-use easy. And to anyone purchasing any vendor-service that offers electronic information, demand that the service offers an API to the data.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/campus-api-ideas/","title":"practical campus APIs & feeds"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/dashboard-initiative/":{"body":"I've been putting some productive time into something I'm calling \"The Dashboard Initiative\". Most of this time to date has been outside of normal work hours due to a few other priorities, but in time I expect to add this to the list of on-going work projects.\nInspired by work done by Brown's Office of Institutional Research, the concept of the dashboard is to provide useful trend information about the operation of different facets of the Library. The analogy to a car dashboard is good: whereas 'instruments' make up a car's dashboard, what I'm calling 'widgets' make up the Library's dashboard.\nAs shown on this dashboard information page, a dashboard widget consists of three counts (baseline, trend, and current), a trend indicator, and a 'more-info' button that itself is a miniature graph. My visions for possible future dashboard usage within the Library and across campus are grand, but it is important to remember that the dashboard idea is intended to serve a rather specific data-display purpose: to usefully display trend information. Data that lends itself to pie-chart breakdowns can be important to an organization and can be an integral part of an organization's data-farm, but is somewhat outside the scope of the dashboard focus on trends.\nOne of the reasons I find the dashboard concept so compelling is that it provides a kind of 'template' for data-tracking feeds. Increasingly we've been building into more projects the ability to stream out statistic counts, but to date there hasn't been a clear standardized vision of how this statistical data might be presented. The dashboard offers that standard.\nIf we were to rebuild from scratch the easyBorrow system, we could from the start automate count-flows that could populate widgets representing trend-usage for Josiah redirects, BorrowDirect, VirtualCatalog, InRhode, and Iliad. This of course applies to all new systems, and over time I expect we'll retrofit many of our existing ad-hoc statistical counts to flow into widgets.\nI have a vision of the creation, over time, of a plethora of widgets representing useful trend-information on checkouts, interlibrary-loan usage, new-titles additions, collections-web-access usage, requests for offsite materials, and physical library attendance to name just a few. This then begs the question of how to manage all these widgets.\nI envision a 'MyWidgets' page where, based on cookies and login, a user could view a listing of all Library widgets, filter by tag, and select those she finds useful for a personalized widget page. As part of my work I may pay particular attention to the flow of easyBorrow requests to our different borrowing partners, and scan other widgets tracking workbench file uploads to our in-development repository. Other folk in the library might be particularly interested in widgets that track numbers of books sent to our offsite Annex facility, as well as widgets that track the number of requests for those materials, and widgets that track how many requests for offsite materials are still made when the user is offered a link to a Google Book scan of the requested title. Our French scholarly resources librarian might choose for her page widgets tracking French new-title additions, as well as checkouts of French-language items.\nThinking even more broadly -- campus-wide -- it's easy to imagine how, if other departments adopt the dashboard idea, a facility could even be developed for, say, the chair of the French department to 'subscribe' to a Library 'French New-Titles' widget, a Library 'French-Language Checkouts' widget, as well as a Registrar widget representing the numbers of freshmen enrolled in French 1, and another Registrar widget representing numbers of French concentrators.\nAlong these lines, I expect to one-day add an rss and html parameter-segment to a widget-url to facilitate such cross-campus usage.\nFor now, starting on a small-scale, I've created via Django's default admin a simple form allowing non-technical end-users to create a widget simply by typing or pasting into the form a list of key-value data-pairs.\n\nUpon submitting the form, the data-points are parsed  and made into the discrete data-elements comprising a widget. This is in-place now. In fact, the widget on the dashboard information page was created (and can easily be updated) via this form. Further, this weekend I implemented the ability to view detail line-chart information using Google's chart API. So changing a label or data-point via the simple form now changes not just the widget but also the detail chart, on-the-fly. Though I expect to automate many data flows used to create dashboard widgets, the utility of the form will allow non-technical folk to take data they already create via manual processes and easily make that data much more visible to others.\nWe'll see how this all unfolds. The potential is exciting.\n[ Update: I presented on the dashboard at the 2009 code4lib conference. Good feedback (DC, ELM). ]\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/dashboard-initiative/","title":"dashboard initiative"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/debouncing-explained/":{"body":"I found this cool, both the good explanation, and the function and concept...

Here's the web-version.]\n\nThirteen presentations were given at the NISO Forum 'Next Generation Discovery: New Tools, Aging Standards', held on March 27 and 28, 2008, in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. They covered three main areas: current user-expectations, discovery tools attempting to meet those expectations, and architectures to facilitate the development and adoption of discovery tools.\nSpeakers reenforced that users want searching to be easy and fast. Dinah Sanders of III noted how this process of finding information has become increasingly iterative, with users expecting to refine their queries. Vinod Chachra of VTLS described that this is why search results must be returned quickly: it allows humans to be seamlessly involved in the discernment process, scanning and instantaneously determining relevancy.\nRobert Sandusky of the University of Illinois at Chicago, Cameilia Csora of 2collab.com, Karen Hawkins of scitopio.org, Dinah, and Peter Murray of OhioLINK, all showed tools that incorporate at least some now-common web elements to meet these user-expectations, including faceted results, tagging, tag-clouds, and feeds.\nMany new discovery tools offer truly laudable interface-improvements over previous displays of information, but suffer from a significant architectural limitation: If a tool assumes the only end-user experience is the tool's default web-page, opportunities for discovery are drastically limited. For example, if we at Brown were to license the III Encore tool, and a user were to land on one of our 'Napoleonic Satires' collection pages, it would be wonderful to be able to query an Encore API on 'Napoleon' to display in a sidebar the terrific discovery data this tool can access. But this and many other discovery tools offer no such API. Fortunately this is changing, with some vendors updating their business models to meet current library discovery needs both deeply and broadly. Ex Libris' XServer licensing is a prime example, offering API functionality to its federated-searching tool, dramatically broadening discovery possibilities beyond the default MetaLib web interface.\nThe presentations that touched on system-design and architectural issues to improve discovery were particularly inspiring. \nRichard Akerman of NRC CISTI noted that we should utilize our power as information-producers to produce data that more easily lends itself to machine-harvesting. This can be done by encoding data where possible utilizing existing standards such as OpenURL and COinS, as well as emerging de-facto standards such as microformats. He showed as one example information displayed in a useful time-line format by a site that had queried data from a harvester site -- possible because of standardized structured date-fields.\nMike Teets of OCLC gave a presentation on OCLC's emerging WorldCat Grid services, offering possibilities for cross-referencing standard identifiers such as ISBNs and OCLC numbers, and emerging identifiers such as 'identities' -- truly a developer's dream.\nVinod offered numerous useful suggestions for designing systems to minimize user confusion and maximize utility. He showed an example of a site that had both a facet category of LC Subject Headings, and another facet category of Dewey Subject Headings, and the ease with which a user could be confused by this explicit display of overlapping information, hindering rather than helping discovery. \nMichael Winkler of the University of Pennsylvania discussed how PennTags is emblematic of an architectural approach the UPenn Library has found successful. His talk brought together multiple threads of this NISO Forum by showing how PennTags offers discovery possibilities in multiple different settings because it is designed as what he called a 'horizontal' service, as opposed to a 'vertical' service. The 'vertical' service paradigm in Winkler's view is exactly the one I described earlier as architecturally limited: much useful information is gathered together and funneled down into one website with no possibilities for alternate exposure of the gathered and massaged data. PennTags, he noted, is an example of the 'horizontal' service paradigm that he sees as the future of UPenn Library discovery software and good discovery software in general. It is not tied to any particular existing service: not the catalog, not electronic resources, not their course-software -- and yet can be used with any of these services -- and in any given context can expose interesting data from another context. Each PennTag entry is exposed as an RSS feed which illustrates the power of simple standards to enhance discovery. In fact, this shift to a horizontal paradigm is so central to the UPenn Library's current and future work, that Winkler noted he toyed with re-titling his presentation to something like 'Not PennTags, but Why'.\nJohn Mark Ockerbloom, also of the University of Pennsylvania, followed with an update on the DLF's 'ILS Discovery Interface Task Force', of which he is the Chair. The task force is set to soon release a standard for ILS discovery services -- in other words, it will set a lightweight API standard for the OPAC layer of the ILS. In the context of this forum, this standard should help foster the shift of the OPAC from a vertical silo-service to a horizontal more flexible one, increasing opportunities for discovery of the underlying OPAC data.\nI hope to see the next Forum in this 'Discovery' series showcase more tools that utilize Winkler's horizontal-service architecture concept that increases discovery possibilities. Kudos to NISO for providing another thought-provoking Forum packed with inspirational examples and ideas and conversation.\nLinks to presentations should be available soon from the NISO event website.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/discovery-tools-standards-trends/","title":"discovery tools, standards, trends"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/django-42-lts/":{"body":"Django released a new long-term-support version. \nThis repo serves as a template for new projects. \nIt contains error_check() and version() view functions.

For those who haven't yet tasted the Django kool-aid, that's a field that requires both a valid date and a valid time. Made sense to me, since one of the main reasons for the site is to be able to list the location and date &amp; time of upcoming meetings. However, when entering a few old meetings, the spreadsheet I was working from only listed the month and year (November 1997! -- we've been around for a while!).\nThere were a couple of ways I could have handled this. What I chose to do was to add two boolean fields: 'fake_date' (meaning 'day') and 'fake_time'. It might have been cleaner to allow we admins to have a year, a month, a date, and a time field -- but I knew going forward the single DateTimeField would work for us and I wanted to build more for the future than the past. So, when entering an old meeting with just a month and year, any date in that month is entered and any time of day, and both fake_date and fake_time are checked.\nThe complete DateTime object is passed to the template, and then some logic goes to work:\n{% if meeting.fake_date %}\n    &lt;h2&gt;{{ meeting.date_time|date:\\\"F, Y\\\"|lower }}&lt;/h2&gt;\n{% else %}\n    {% if meeting.fake_time %}\n        &lt;h2&gt;{{ meeting.date_time|date:\\\"l, F jS, Y\\\"|lower }}&lt;/h2&gt;\n    {% endif %}\n{% endif %}\n\n{% if not meeting.fake_date and not meeting.fake_time %}\n    &lt;h2&gt;{{ meeting.date_time|date:\\\"l, F jS, Y g:iA\\\"|lower }}&lt;/h2&gt;\n{% endif %}\n\nI could have more efficiently handled the 'happy-path' real-date case via nesting, but I find this a bit more readable.\nIf the first test matches, the DateTime object info will only show, as an example, 'march 1998'; if the second test matches, the same DateTime object will only show 'march 6, 1998', but not the time.\nThis is nice. My introduction to templates was in Java, via JSPs, using expression-language to pass in values from beans. Since pure java code can be embedded in JSPs, I had trained myself to rigidly keep logic out of templates, and in the above situation would have written that logic within a Java class. When I began working more with php, I looked around for a template system. I had heard good things about 'smarty', but it seemed too heavyweight. That, combined with my fierce aversion to template logic, scared me off. I then attended a wonderful presentation on HTML_Template_ITX, was sold whole-hog, and still use that for my php end-user web work. \nWhat I initially loved about Django's templates is that I didn't have to use any of the logical conditions I show above; it can be used very well very simply. As I've grown more comfortable with Django and python, my philosophical aversion to template-logic has gradually diminished -- as long as it's presentation logic. The situation above is a perfect example: It's very reasonable for the business-logic end of things to pass to the presentation-layer a date. How that date is then formatted (upper or lowercase, whether or not the day or other elements of the date are shown, etc.) is a very reasonable thing for the template to handle. And that the template can also handle the presentation based on certain conditions of the Meeting instance is very, very, nice.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/django-templates/","title":"appreciating django templates"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/i-love-hate-python-docstrings-for-testing/":{"body":"I have a love-hate relationship with using python docstrings for testing. They're simple, easy-to-use, and provide both usage-documentation and actual unit-test functionality. But whenever I start using them in any serious extensive way, I go back to using regular unit-tests in a file or directory -- because of limitations of docstring-tests. So I haven't used them in a while.

I remembered docstrings for testing, and I'm once-again in the love-phase.\nHere's a function in some experimental code a few of us are working on -- to which I added a few docstring-tests.

Though the documentation indicated that macports would automatically edit my .profile file; it didn't, so I added two paths to my .profile file:\n  export PATH=$PATH:/opt/local/bin        \n  export PATH=$PATH:/opt/local/var/macports/\n\n\n\nLooked good:\n  birkinbox:~ birkin$         \n  birkinbox:~ birkin$ which port        \n  /opt/local/bin/port        \n  birkinbox:~ birkin$         \n  birkinbox:~ birkin$ sudo port selfupdate        \n      \n  MacPorts base version 1.600 installed        \n\n  Downloaded MacPorts base version 1.600        \n          \n  The MacPorts installation is not outdated and so was not updated        \n  selfupdate done!        \n  birkinbox:~ birkin$ \\r\\n  \\r\\n  * wireshark found:\\r\\n          \n  birkinbox:~ birkin$         \n  birkinbox:~ birkin$ port search 'wireshark'        \n  wireshark                      net/wireshark  0.99.8       Graphical network analyzer and capture tool        \n  birkinbox:~ birkin$ \\r\\n    \\r\\n  * but install unsuccessful:\\r\\n          \n  birkinbox:~ birkin$         \n  birkinbox:~ birkin$ sudo port install 'wireshark'        \n  Password:        \n  ---&gt;  Fetching expat        \n  ---&gt;  Attempting to fetch expat-2.0.1.tar.gz from http://downloads.sourceforge.net/expat        \n  ---&gt;  Verifying checksum(s) for expat        \n  ---&gt;  Extracting expat        \n  ---&gt;  Configuring expat        \n  Error: Target org.macports.configure returned: configure failure: shell command \\\" cd \\\"/opt/local/var/macports/build/_opt_local_var_macports_sources_rsync.macports.org_release_ports_textproc_expat/work/expat-2.0.1\\\" &amp;&amp; ./configure --prefix=/opt/local --mandir=/opt/local/share/man \\\" returned error 77        \n  Command output: checking build system type... i386-apple-darwin9.2.0        \n  checking host system type... i386-apple-darwin9.2.0        \n  checking for gcc... /usr/bin/gcc-4.0        \n  checking for C compiler default output file name... configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables        \n  See `config.log' for more details.        \n          \n  Error: The following dependencies failed to build: glib2 gettext expat libiconv gperf ncurses ncursesw pkgconfig gtk2 atk cairo fontconfig freetype zlib libpng render xrender gtk-doc docbook-xml-4.1.2 xmlcatmgr docbook-xsl libxml2 perl5.8 scrollkeeper docbook-xml docbook-xml-4.2 docbook-xml-4.3 docbook-xml-4.4 docbook-xml-4.5 libxslt p5-xml-parser jpeg pango Xft2 xorg-xproto xorg-util-macros shared-mime-info tiff libpcap openssl        \n  Error: Status 1 encountered during processing.        \n  birkinbox:~ birkin$ \n\n\n\nAnother step back to try and figure this out.\n\n\n'Amer from Boston' (link http://www.anders.com/cms/241/Wireshark/MacPorts no longer active), has some steps he said worked for him; I'll try them.\n  sudo port -v install gtk2 +x11\n\n  birkinbox:~ birkin$         \n  birkinbox:~ birkin$ sudo port -v install gtk2 +x11        \n  Password:        \n  ---&gt;  Configuring expat        \n  checking build system type... i386-apple-darwin9.2.0        \n  checking host system type... i386-apple-darwin9.2.0        \n  checking for gcc... /usr/bin/gcc-4.0        \n  checking for C compiler default output file name... configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables        \n  See `config.log' for more details.        \n  Error: Target org.macports.configure returned: configure failure: shell command \\\" cd \\\"/opt/local/var/macports/build/_opt_local_var_macports_sources_rsync.macports.org_release_ports_textproc_expat/work/expat-2.0.1\\\" &amp;&amp; ./configure --prefix=/opt/local --mandir=/opt/local/share/man \\\" returned error 77        \n  Command output: checking build system type... i386-apple-darwin9.2.0        \n  checking host system type... i386-apple-darwin9.2.0        \n  checking for gcc... /usr/bin/gcc-4.0        \n  checking for C compiler default output file name... configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables        \n  See `config.log' for more details.        \n          \n  Warning: the following items did not execute (for expat): org.macports.activate org.macports.configure org.macports.build org.macports.destroot org.macports.install        \n  Error: The following dependencies failed to build: atk gettext expat libiconv gperf ncurses ncursesw glib2 pkgconfig cairo fontconfig freetype zlib libpng render xrender gtk-doc docbook-xml-4.1.2 xmlcatmgr docbook-xsl libxml2 perl5.8 scrollkeeper docbook-xml docbook-xml-4.2 docbook-xml-4.3 docbook-xml-4.4 docbook-xml-4.5 libxslt p5-xml-parser jpeg pango Xft2 xorg-xproto xorg-util-macros shared-mime-info tiff        \n  Error: Status 1 encountered during processing.        \n  birkinbox:~ birkin$ \n\n\n\nConsulting installation documentation (bad link: http://trac.macports.org/projects/macports/wiki/InstallingMacPorts) from main documentation page (bad link: http://trac.macports.org/projects/macports). Reading through the docs I see there's a lot I didn't do that I need to, but pretty basic stuff. This is good; it's always nice to have ideas about why something's not working.\n\n\nxcode 3.0 is required; I thought I had installed that when I installed Leopard, but there's no /Developer directory in the new installation (only one is in the 'Previous Systems' directory) so I must not have. Downloading the (big) intaller.\n\n\nThe modified date on the Utilities/X11.app is 2008-02-29, which is when I installed Leopard. So I suspect that the selection I remember on the install was for the X11 install, not the whole xcode package.\n\n\nHmmn... the macports xcode-installation docs say \"Click Customize, expand the Applications category and click the checkbox beside X11 SDK to add it to the default items.\" ...but the xcode installer didn't have an Applications category; proceeding with install.\n\n\nLooks like it went ok.\n\n\nLooks like a good source of Leopard X11 info (bad link: http://homepage.mac.com/sao1/X11/index.html).\n\n\nBased on intall docs, revised ~/.profile to:\n  # for macport install (2008-03-21)        \n  export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH        \n  export DISPLAY=:0.0\n\n\n\nThe 'Verify the shell environment' section instructs to run 'env' to confirm that the initial paths are the MacPort paths, like:\n  PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin  \n\n\n\nMy path has the old '/sw/' paths previously installed via Fink:\n  birkinbox:~ birkin$         \n  birkinbox:~ birkin$ env        \n  ...        \n  PATH=/sw/bin:/sw/sbin::/usr/lib/php/:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:...        \n  ...        \n  birkinbox:~ birkin$ \n\n\n\nOk, disabled the fink stuff; the php lib still comes before the macport directories, but I'm thinking that's ok. Onward...\n\n\nTrying the wireshark install again... OMG, I'm over an hour into the install command and stuff's still being downloaded and installed. Is this a natural series of dependencies? Or is an entire 'base' environment being installed? I now seem to remember something similar with Fink. It's not at all necessary to list all this output, but I'm going to, for the strange geeky factor, and because over the years I've been occasionlly been surprised at the benefits of having this bizarre documentation.\n  birkinbox:~ birkin$         \n  birkinbox:~ birkin$ sudo port install 'wireshark'        \n  Password:        \n  ---&gt;

I envisioned over time building up libraries of class-objects; by accessing them in future projects, I expected to be more and more productive.\nCode-reuse never quite worked out that way, though. What I've tended to do for new projects has been to copy a similar class from a previous project, paste it into the new project, weed out unnecessary attributes and methods, and add new code. In a way this makes sense: though I lose out on 'pure' code-reuse, I gain by having all code for a project together. That's nice for version-control and portability, and isolation of concerns in that I don't have to worry that a change in a class in one project will have unintended consequences in another project.\nBut reading a while back about service-oriented-architecture, and shortly thereafter having a need to code a couple of lines in python that I had just coded in php a day or two earlier -- the benefits of moving code into RESTful web-services, that is: moving it onto the network, became apparent.\nI do that all the time now. Just last week I had a need to convert between 10 and 13-digit isbns -- for the second time in a recent project, so rather than coding the conversion directly in the program at hand I put it into a webservice.\nIn this shift, I've finally realized that goal of code reuse, while still being able to maintain the version-control and isolation of concerns benefits of focusing on my specific project at hand.\nThe book 'RESTful Web Services' by Richardson and Ruby, while a bit dense, offers good insights on creating web-services (example: versioning). At some point, I'd like to come up with standards for Brown Library (and/or campus-wide) web-services. Examples: specifying versioning in the url, a documention url in the returned data, and a url in that documentation of all APIs/web-services the department offers.\nFor now, though, the simple shift toward moving code out of individual projects and onto the network has been rewarding.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/moving-code-onto-network/","title":"moving code onto the network"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/nice-soa-implementation/":{"body":"I've evangelized service-oriented architecture (SOA) before. \nTo review, briefly and roughly: SOA promotes decoupled services. For example, a Fahrenheit-to-Celsius converter would likely be implemented as a web-service, instead of as a function/method embedded/tied into some bigger program. The benefits of this are multiple: 1) The service can be written in any programming language, and accessed by other services written in different languages. 2) SOA makes the idealized promise of code-reuse a reality.\nI have a programmer friend who works for a large corporation who is familiar with implementing SOA using industrial-scale best-practices; I'm familiar with implementing it in a lightweight, seat-of-the-pants fashion.\nOver the past year+ I've created well over a dozen or so SOA web-services for different projects. But I recently implemented one I put some best-practice effort into that'll be a model for my future SOA work. Some links:\n[2023 update -- the march of progress has resulted in the retirement of these services, so no active links. Sorry!]\nhttp://library.brown.edu/services/language_translator/\nhttp://library.brown.edu/services/language_translator/api_v1/code_eng/\nhttp://library.brown.edu/services/language_translator/api_v1/all/\nhttp://library.brown.edu/services/language_translator/list/\nWhat I like about this one...\n\n\nThe api urls offer 'discovery' via embedding, in the built-in returned data, contact and documentation information. Having just one of these pieces of info would be great; having both is particularly nice because web urls and staff change over time. Why is this useful? If someone is looking at the code that calls this service 5 years from now, and if I'm not around, the documentation will provide info on some extra features of the service that otherwise wouldn't be apparent if, say, the web-service just returned the word 'English'\n\n\nThe api urls are 'hackable', another way of enhancing discovery. One can intuitively try entering a code other than 'enk' to see what comes up (like 'tlh'). Also, reasonably appropriate things happen if one lops off increasing sections of the url (in this case, redirects to documentation pages).\n\n\nThe api urls are versioned. Key:value pairs can be added to this api -- but the existing key:value pairs must never be changed. The reason is that post-release, I don't know who's using it for what, thus I have to assume any changes could break someone's app. So if I want to change the label 'response' to 'language', and deliver it in xml, I can leave the existing one as is, and label the new one 'api_v2'.\n\n\nAll these urls utilize server-caching. This is an implementation rather than a design feature, but worth mentioning. Django offers a flexible and easy-to-use caching feature; I have it set so that the list and api urls only have to hit the database once a day, no matter how many times the urls are hit. Further, django's caching is intelligent: its response includes 'Cache-Control', 'Etag', and 'Expires' http-headers so that a browser or well-designed code doesn't even have to call the web-service again to redisplay the data. Nice. This would be particularly important and useful for something like RSS feeds. \n\n\nGood info...\n\n\nA terrific, hands-on review-resource on http-headers: The web-services chapter of Mark Pilgrims 'Dive Into Python' website &amp; book.\n\n\nMany of the features of this language_translator web-service were informed by the book 'RESTful Web Services', by Richardson &amp; Ruby. Some parts are a bit dense, but it's chock-full of terrific detailed info and food for thought. I came across it after having written a half-dozen or so SOA web-services, each one a little different and better, and it directly addressed many issues I had begun to think about or saw referenced via web-research.\n\n\n[Acknowledgements to Peter Murray's article and Richard Akerman's Access_2006 presentation that first inspired my SOA thinking.]\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/nice-soa-implementation/","title":"nice lightweight SOA implementation"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/non-tesla-charging-challenges/":{"body":"Update: the gloom is lifting! Read why!\n\nI had a Chevy Bolt from 2018 through 2021 that I loved. It was a requirement of the lease that I had to return it at the end of the lease; I'd have bought it otherwise.\nDuring the time I had it, I took three very long trips (750-1,000 miles round-trip) to see what that was like. And I  took many other shorter long trips that required DC fast-charging (often referred to as \"level-3-charging\") --  as opposed to slower AC home-charging using the equivalent of an electric-dryer outlet (often referred to as \"level-2-charging\").\nThe Bolt is known to fast-charge very slowly. But it has great range, and is super-efficient (so it makes the most of every kilowatt it gets). I loved those trips. BUT... I went into those trips with a sense of adventure: I knew, from reading accounts of fast-charging non-Teslas, that I had to treat those trips like an airplane-pilot charting a trip. I had a backup-charging-plan, and at least some awareness of a back-up to the back-up plan. And I built-in lots of extra travel-time for possible charging issues. \nThere were often slower EV-Go fast-charging stations that were my back-up-plan to the main higher-speed Electrify-America (EA) fast-charging stations I usually used. At many EA stations, half the chargers wouldn't work at all, or would only work with multiple attempts. But that generally wasn't an issue, because there were rarely any other EVs there.\nNow, however, there are many terrific non-Teslas being sold -- the Ford Mustang Mach-E, the Ford Lightning pickup, the VW ID-4, and the Hyundai Ioniq-5 being a few -- but that means that the lack of EA reliability has become much more of an issue as more cars vie for working fast-chargers. Here's a recent youtube video that gives a sense of the kinds of charging issues that folk are experiencing.\nI replaced my Bolt with a Tesla Model 3. I love the car -- but there are definitely things about the Bolt that I miss. But Tesla fast-charging on long trips is unbelievably better. \nI can get in my Tesla, in Rhode Island, and push the voice-button and say \"Directions to Chicago\". The car knows how full my \"tank\" is, and routes me to a convenient fast-charging station on my way. As I get close, the car automatically prepares the battery to accept a fast-charge. The smallest charging-station I've ever seen had 8 chargers; most have a dozen or more. I pull up, unhook the charging-cable-plug, press a button on the plug that opens my car's charge-port, and plug it in. That's it[*]. It charges, fast. And most crucially, I simply don't have to even think about it not working (I think I've had only one or two times where I had to move over and use another cable, out of many hundreds of fast-charges). The importance of that reliability cannot be overstated: it is just not a concern. Contrast that experience with the youtube video above.\nMy EV evangelism is by no means Tesla specific. But I'm very sad to say that I can no longer recommend a non-Tesla EV to anyone if:\n\nit's going to be your only car, and...\nif you want to be able to even occasionally take long trips\n\n(If it's a second-car, or you'll just be using it for normal daily life, my all-brands EV evangelism stands. You charge at home, and start of each day with a full battery.)\nI just honestly wouldn't want my loved ones to have to go through the current all-too-common anxiety of getting a needed fast-charge along the highway in a non-Tesla. I really hope the current publicity around terrible charging experiences helps push companies to prioritize reliability. An increased number of chargers will address range-anxiety, but if they don't work reliably, real charging-anxiety and understandable frustration will result, harming EV-adoption.\nIn the future, I'm sure we'll look back on these days like the proverbial elders that talked of walking miles to school through snowstorms, but for now the hassles are real and terribly sad.\n\n[*] Re fast-charging, \"What about payment?\" you may wonder. The fast-chargers automatically use the credit-card associated with your car.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/non-tesla-charging-challenges/","title":"non-Tesla charging challenges"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/ok-again-to-buy-non-teslas/":{"body":"(Update: more automakers have announced they'll adopt NACS!)\n\nthe good news\nWith the announcement by General Motors this past Thursday that it will adopt the North American Charging Standard (NACS) fast-charger -- giving it access to many of Tesla's fast-chargers -- I can officially once again whole-heartedly evangelize non-Tesla EVs! (From Ford &amp; GM; Ford announced the same two weeks ago.)\nJust few months ago I had said I was terribly disappointed that I could no longer recommend buying a non-Tesla EV if...\n\nit was going to be one's only car, and... \none wanted to be able to even occasionally take long trips\n\nThe reason for my dampened non-Tesla EV enthusiasm was two-fold:\n\nThe non-Tesla fast-charging network, though slowly growing, has real reliability issues (link-1,  link-2). (This is in contrast to Tesla's fast-charging network, which is extremely reliable.)\nThe number of fantastic non-Tesla EVs has significantly increased, greatly exacerbating the frequency of terrible fast-charging experiences for non-Tesla EVs.\n\nbackground\nThe non-Tesla fast-charging system is comprised of a bunch of different companies not directly related to the main auto-companies. It uses a fast-charge plug and standard called CCS-1; Tesla's fast-charge plug and standard, NACS, is different. For a while, Tesla tried to get its fast-charger adopted to be a standard, but was unsuccessful. \nLast Fall Tesla released its fast-charger as an open standard -- with no takers. Though Tesla claimed it was open to other companies using its fast-chargers, most observers assessed that other auto-companies didn't want to be seen as in any way supporting upstart Tesla that has so disrupted the business-model of the traditional automakers. Second, many were suspicious that Tesla was serious. It's a huge competitive advantage for Tesla not to allow others to use its network. \nBut apparently Tesla was serious. Further, in addition to allowing Ford and GM to use its fast-chargers, it committed to fully opening its fast-charger-APIs to allow Ford and GM to completely integrate all fast-charger-availability and payment-processing through Ford's and GM's apps (not the Tesla app). Tesla fans aren't convinced that this is good for Tesla as a company, because even though Tesla will make money from charging for electricity, it'll completely lose a major competitive sales advantage (this post is an example of that). Still, the vast majority of Telsa fans are excited about this, because it will help advance EV adoption -- a core Tesla mission.\nAlready some of the big third-party charging companies have stated that they'll add NACS cables to their chargers. Most analysts believe it's just a matter of time before remaining auto-companies selling EVs in the U.S. make similar announcements. (Tesla makes up some two-thirds of the U.S. EV market; Tesla, Ford and GM together make up about three-fourths.)\nthe import\nThe reason this is so important is that Tesla's fast-charging stations are super-reliable. That means...\n\nfolk with non-Teslas will no longer have charging-anxiety on long trips\nnon-Tesla charging networks will have to dramatically improve their reliability once the non-Tesla owners see how reliable charging can be at the Tesla fast-charging stations\n\nThe wonderful icing on the cake is that the Tesla-NACS charger-plug is much, much better than the non-Tesla-CCS charger-plug. This is acknowledged even by folk who dislike Tesla. Look at this comparison-picture from the Electrek website. The NACS plug (in black) is smaller and significantly easier to handle, and the receiver port in the car works for both fast-charging and at-home-slow-charging.\nThis is a real win for consumers and for the adoption of EVs.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/ok-again-to-buy-non-teslas/","title":"go forth and buy (some) non-tesla EVs!"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/polyphasic-sleep/":{"body":"From June 2006 for just over a year I tried a modified polyphasic sleep regimen, and blogged about it here.\nAn excerpt from that page...\nPolyphasic sleep refers to a practice of getting sleep needs met through multiple (often very short) sleep sessions instead of the usual single night-time sleep session.\nAs has happened in other realms, the Internet allowed the relatively few individuals interested in such ideas to publicly share information and experiences, which exposed many others to these ideas.

I verified the params for the solr calls, ran them against my proxy-webapp, and it looked like it should have been working. Turns out that the project calling solr was using an old library, solrpy, which builds the select-data via POSTing form-like params to solr (using xml IIRC). Solr handles that just fine, but my proxy didn't, so I had to deal with the POST.\nIf I had to do this from the beginning, I'd start by looking at the params whether from a POST or GET, and should refactor to do that, but I had the code written (with tests), to expect a querystring, and to validate the params in the querystring, etc..., and was feeling a time-pressure, so I figured I'd just convert the POST params to a querystring and pass that querystring to the pre-existing code.\nDid that, and then, when pointing the webapp to my proxy-webapp, most things worked, but not all.\nquerydict ≠ dict\nThat round of debugging also took some time, because whereas the original solr calls were all being made by python code, the solr calls that weren't working were being made by various javascript calls to a webapp-api (to avoid cross-site domain issues). Turns out the calls coming from javascript had lots of same-param fields. Here's an example:\nq=*:*+AND+display_status:approved&amp;facet.field=type&amp;facet.field=physical_type&amp;facet.field=language&amp;facet.field=religion&amp;facet.field=material&amp;facet.field=placeMenu&amp;indent=on&amp;fl=type&amp;start=0&amp;rows=0&amp;facet=on&amp;wt=json\n\n...there are six facet.field keys there.\nMy original convert-POST-to-GET code was treating the post-params as a regular dict (oops), and so was only passing one value to solr (since regular dicts don't allow multiple identical keys). I wanted to update the Django QueryDict (a Django dict-like structure that allows multiple identical keys) -- to validate the par, but the original django Querydict wasn't mutable, so I couldn't simply remove non-legit params.\nSo I made a copy (probably not in the most efficient way), and iterated through the original incoming Querydict's keys -- but actually updated the copy's params.

This is called recursion. There's a wonderful slightly mysterious inverted mobius-strip-like quality to recursion, except that if done right, processing doesn't continue on forever.\nThe code above neatly meets the needs of a project I'm working on: to prepare a hierarchical listing of folders. Not shown is an initial step in which a query is made for a user-specific list of 'top-level' folders -- that is, folders which do not have a parent folder. For each folder in this list, the folder is first appended to a sort of global list-of-folders-to-return. Then a check is made to see if the folder has any children. If so, those child-folders are selected, and passed to the function itself. So for each top-level folder, a processing-chain begins that might be very, very long, or might be very short. But each processing-chain does terminate, shifting to examine the next sibling folder, and, when there are no more sibling-folders in the lowest-level generation, shifting back upward a generation to examine and process the next sibling-folder.\nI use recursion infrequently enough that it sort of gets buried in my toolbox. I forget about it and from habit reach for other tools first that often do the looping job well-enough. Utilizing looping-logic is a fundamental part of programming. Where a built-in looping structure doesn't directly solve looping needs, I most often use a Controller-pattern solution to a looping challenge. That is, I'll have a controller block of code prepare a list of items that need to be looped through, and perhaps set some variables to hold the results of processing, and then call a separate function that handles the actual looping. Sometimes for more complex situations the called looping code can itself call another separate block of looping code. So it is possible to handle some situations, for which recursion might be ideal, with other techniques. But not all situations -- when my usual looping implementation begins feeling overly complex, that's often a sign to root around and dust off the recursion tool.\nDespite some left-over 1960's geek-stereotypes about programming being a boring left-brain process, there can be elegance and deep beauty in programming. There are numerous ways to approach and solve a challenge, any of which may work 'well-enough'. Good programmers strive for solutions that are simplest and clearest, and when the right technique lends itself to beautifully simple code, one feels like an artist.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/recursion/","title":"recursion"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/shib-and-fedora/":{"body":"[2023 update -- our repository architecture has changed significantly (I'll post about it sometime), so this post (like so many old tech-posts) is for posterity. 🙂 ]\n\nI don't work directly on Fedora (our repository software), but am very familiar with it due to my work with a programmer who does, and because I've worked on a django front-end for ingestion of items into fedora, as well as fedora-apis. My role in fedora work is more akin to the 'corner-man' in boxing. Together the boxer and I strategize about the opponent, his defenses and threats to our plans, and devise approaches to deal with evolving challenges. We cross ourselves, the fedora programmer goes into the ring, and between rounds I provide moral support, bandage wounds, and, because of my distance from actual battle, sometimes have useful ideas for the next round. This analogy's negativity toward the Fedora software is appropriate; to use another: We've bought a car that, in hindsight, I wouldn't recommend to others, but that we're committed to getting some terrific mileage out of.\nSo, it's been a tough fight, but our boxer is quick, has impressive endurance, and we believe we'll come out on top.\nFedora authorization is one round in which we think we've scored well.\nFedora comes bundled with an authorization piece called XACML. I don't know if it's due to xacml, or fedora's implementation of it, but from what I gather indirectly, it's terrifying enough that few use it, and it is, in fact, scheduled to be augmented in a future release with a new Great Hope: FeSL.\nBut if you want to go into production now, what to do? The dearth of published authentication/authorization 'live' solutions is why, as I understand it, so many fedora installations are either completely open (all objects public), or completely locked down for internal use.\nWe've assumed we would use some sort of wrapper around fedora, to authenticate against Shibboleth, with which our university is slowly moving forward. Shib's lack of logout capability, and the resultant assumption that users will happily quit their browser to logout, would seem quaintly amusing if it weren't true -- but that is another topic entirely, and single sign-on is certainly convenient. Not long ago we began to tackle how, specifically, to implement shib/fedora authorization.\nRecently someone described to me an authorization approach the muradora folk took. I haven't looked at any documentation myself, but I was told that they wrote a servlet filter that takes a submitted name and password, and passes it to a non-centralized custom ldap server that exists only for the purpose of allowing fedora's built in ldap-xacml code to handle authentication. (For those unfamiliar: a java servlet filter acts as a front layer of a java webapp through which incoming requests and outgoing responses must pass, and can be modified.) \nA few of us heard this and had divergent reactions. It sounded like a hack, which caused some to dismiss the approach. Personally, being quite partial to hacks that work around monolithic software obstacles, I thought the hack smacked of ingenious creativity and was worth further examination. I was indulged; the result: our corner has devised an approach that initial testing indicates will work well.\nFirst, some necessary background info... \n\n\nOur University shib implementation is integrated with Grouper. I think grouper is, or at least historically has been, a separate project from shibboleth, but they work together brilliantly. Upon shib-login, a list of the groups to which the user belongs is accessible to the server via the shib 'is-member-of' header field.\n\n\nOur implementation of fedora item ingestion involves creating a METS record that contains a bunch of item-info -- including a rights segment. The rights segment contains a series of entries, each one listing an identity (a shib is-member-of group) and a permission. Example (content, not format): identity='chemistry-department' &amp; permission='view_item'\n\n\nThe mets record is handed to an ingester that converts the mets xml to FOXML, then fedora grabs the object (we're using the 'managed' option at the moment), and the java messaging built into fedora fires off a message to a listener that indexes (via Solr) parts of the foxml record, including the rights information.\n\n\nSo, our approach: create a fedora servlet filter that reads the shib groups/identities, then does a solr search to see if the object being requested has a 'view' permission for any of the identities in the request's shib is-member-of header. If so, the request is allowed through; if not; it is blocked. If no shib-identity is found, the servlet filter will only yield objects with 'public' view_item permissions. \nThe beauty of this is that fedora-access can be fully open to the internet while still allowing authorized access for those objects that require it. Further, this solution offers reasonable hope that it will survive fedora upgrades, since the servlet, though a part of the fedora webapp, is somewhat of a separate layer in front of the app. Further, by adding more granular permissions (at the moment permissions are at the object-level; they could be at the data-stream level) -- or simply by a bit of extra programming in the servlet-filter -- we could allow, say, the public to access low and medium-resolution images, but allow, say, faculty to access high-resolution images.\nI'll keep this paragraph updated... Our intrepid programmer has figured out where to insert the custom servlet filter, has worked with our systems person to hook up an initial apache/tomcat connection so as to allow the shib installation on apache to pass its headers through to tomcat, and confirmed the filter's detection of the shib identity header information. A nice side-effect of installing shib on apache rather than tomcat directly is that we can allow programmatic access to port 8080.\nThe bell has rung; the next round begins. We cross our fingers, and the programmer heads into the ring once again.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/shib-and-fedora/","title":"shibboleth and fedora"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/ssh-tunneling-notes/":{"body":"\nThis was first posted in 2006, to a no-longer-accessible wiki, to accompany a \"Brown Internet Programming Group\" talk I gave.\n\nThe problem\nThe situation: My preferred way of working is to program, on my laptop, code that often must communicate with a database running on a remote server. What are good ways of handling this?\nIn the past I used two different approaches.\n\nRun a parallel database.\n\nPros: good when lots of database development/reconfiguration is required. No separate connection file is needed.\nCons: testing may lead to need to spend effort keeping database structures and sometimes data in sync.\n\n\nAccess the remote database by programming the connection-code to determine which host its running on. If running on my laptop, the connection-code would locate the database at an internet address; if running on the same server as the database, the connection-code would locate the database at the localhost address.\n\nPros: Only need to deal with one database.\nCons: Non-localhost connectivity may be disabled for security reasons. If others work on the same code, the differing connection-code to detect multiple hosts can be a hassle and can reveal internet passwords. Care must be taken since the password may be transmitted over a non-secure connection.\n\n\n\nSolution: Another programmer showed me how he solves this issue via ssh-tunneling. It's a wonderful solution.\nOverview\nBackground info to keep in mind: Common client-server internet connections generally generally do not require specification of originating ports (the computers can pick a port), but do require specification of destination ports.\nExample: my browser wants to access a web-page. My browser may send out the http request from any of a range of ports, but will specifically access the server's IP address at port 80, where the web-server is listening.\nIn ssh-tunneling, the client computer is set up to 'listen' for incoming data on a specified port at the 127.0.0.1 localhost IP address -- and to 'forward' that data, via a pre-established ssh connection, to a specific port at the server's IP address. This terminology may be a bit confusing, because the 'client' -- say, the local development laptop -- is 'listening', which a 'server' normally does. In this case, think of the server as a remote database-server.\nWhat this means for my database situation is that I set up my laptop to listen for incoming data at '127.0.0.1:3306' and to forward that data to 'somehost.services.brown.edu:3306'. All I have to do in my connection code is specify that it attempt to connect to the database at '127.0.0.1:3306'.\nThe beauty of this is two-fold...\nFirst, the same connection code can run on my laptop and on the server with no modification at all. Example of php connection code...\n&lt;?php\n    mysql_connect(\\\"127.0.0.1:3306\\\", \\\"username\\\", \\\"password\\\") or die (\\\"Sorry, cannot connect to server\\\");\n    mysql_select_db(\\\"databasename\\\") or die (\\\"Sorry, cannnot connect to database\\\");\n?&gt;\n\nSecond, because the 'set up' is using SSH as the fowarding mechanism, all data is transferred securely.\nNote that there are many different ways of tunneling; this page focuses on one: 'local client' to 'remote service' (in this case, a remote database server).\nSetting up the tunnel\nUnices\nOn Linux, Unix, and the Mac, setting up a tunnel is as easy as issuing one command in a terminal window:\nssh -N -L 3306:somehost.services.brown.edu:3306 myaccount@somehost.services.brown.edu\n\nEven if you're going to use a GUI client to set up the tunnel, examine the details of this command to get an understanding of what's going on:\n\nThe ssh part is the normal secure-shell command.\nThe -N flag specifies that commands flowing over this connection won't be executed on the remote computer, just forwarded.\nThe -L flag specifies the details of the 'localPort:remoteHost:remotePort' section that follows this flag. It means that the local computer should listen for incoming connections on the specified localPort, and forward them over the ssh connection to the remote computer at the remotePort.\nThe 'myaccount@somehost.services.brown.edu' sets up the ssh connection. This prompts me to enter my account-password on the remote computer 'somehost'.\n\nMac: Fugu\nFugu is an open-source ssh client that supports ssh tunneling.\nTo set up a tunnel in fugu:\n\nSelect 'SSH' -&gt; 'New SSH Tunnel'\nEnter 'somehost.services.brown.edu' in the 'Create Tunnel to' textbox'.\nEnter '3306' in the 'Service or Port' textbox (think of this as the 'Remote Port').\nEnter '3306' in the 'Local Port' textbox.\nEnter 'somehost.services.brown.edu' in the 'Remote Host' textbox.\n\nI'm not sure of the distinction between the two 'host' textboxes, but entering info this way works.\n\n\nEnter your username in the 'Username' textbox.\nEnter '22' in the 'Port' textbox (think of this as the 'SSH Port').\n\nWindows: Putty\nPutty is a free Brown-offered ssh client that supports tunneling.\n\nOpen 'putty.exe' file. The 'PuTTy Configuration' window appears.\nClick once on 'Category' -&gt; 'Session'.\nOn the right-side of the window enter 'somehost.services.brown.edu' in the 'Host Name (or IP address)' textbox.\nEnter '22' in the 'Port' textbox.\nSelect 'SSH' for the 'Protocol'.\nClick once on 'Category' -&gt; 'SSH' -&gt; 'Tunnels'.\nEnter '3306' in the 'Source port' textbox.\nEnter 'somehost.services.brown.edu:3306' in the 'Destination' textbox.\nSelect the 'Remote' radio-button under the 'Destination' textbox.\nClick the 'Add' button.\nClick the 'Open' button. The putty terminal window opens.\nWhen prompted by 'login as', enter your username and hit return.\nWhen prompted by for your password, enter it and hit return.\nThat's it; the tunnel is established.\n\nMore tunnel fun\nWeb\nThe idea...\nssh -N -L 5005:123.123.123.123:80 myaccount@123.123.123.123\n\nTo implement this in Fugu or Putty, just switch the IP address, use '5005' for the 'Local Port' (Fugu) or 'Source Port' (Putty), and use '80' for the 'Service or Port' (Fugu) or the port following the host+colon in the 'Category' -&gt; 'SSH' -&gt; 'Tunnels' 'Destination' textbox (Putty).\nYou can then access a web page on the 123.123.123.123 server using an http://127.0.0.1:5005 address instead of the normal http://123.123.123.123 address.\nNote that the 5005 'localPort' can really be any unused port above 1000. The only reason I keep the 'localPort' and 'remoteHostPort' the same in the database example is so my database connection code is the same and works the same on my development laptop and the actual database server.\nOther\nNote that these techniques can be applied in a wide variety of situations. \n\nI've switched over to tunneled connections from Eclipse, my programming IDE, to my Subversion repositories. \nBrown email is encrypted over the network, but if you have a home account that's not, you can check it from a coffee-shop unencrypted wireless network using ssh-tunneling.\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/ssh-tunneling-notes/","title":"ssh tunneling notes"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/statement/":{"body":"I just today ran a disk-search on some text and saw an old ClarisWorks-format file named \"statement\" that, curious, I opened. It's a statement that was part of my application to the Masters of Science in Internet Engineering program of \"The Person's School of Marlboro College\"[*], the graduate school of Marlboro College. The eighth paragraph, where I conveyed a sense of what I would like to do in the future, struck me; I hadn't remembered writing it. Interesting how life works out...\n\nFor over fifteen years I have been captivated by the way in which computers have created possibilities for people to work together. In the 1980s I attached a 300-baud modem to my first Mac, and discovered a world of local bulletin-board systems as well as a national service called GEnie. Though GEnie used a text interface, it hosted a game which allowed members to engage in aerial combat via downloaded software. I was fascinated by this union of a graphical front-end to underlying networking.\nThis interest in computers connecting people led me to create a local BBS I ran for two years which focused on social change issues and introducing non-technical folk to the benefits of email and discussion groups.\nMy immersion in the design and logic of BBS-hosting software primed my move from desktop publishing to database programming. I created a discussion area on America Online (the 'FoxBASE/Mac Coffeehouse') devoted to the exchange of tips and techniques, and learned first-hand how powerful a learning tool a national network can be. It was during this intensive period of dBASE programming, working on a series of complex multi-user systems, that I learned programming constructs (memory variables, loops, conditional branching, etc.) that have proven invaluable to this day. I have since created a few small educational programs using REALbasic, an object-oriented programming environment similar to Visual Basic.\nFor years I have dabbled with web-page creation, but my interest in the web has grown significantly as I have begun to experiment with moving beyond static pages.\nMy first dynamic web project was the creation of an automated script that twice a day exported data from multiple office databases to text-files, massaged these files in a text-editor, and then uploaded them to a webserver where the new data was displayed via server-side-includes. Exciting, but still not interactive.\nOver the past year, I have begun to learn PHP and MySQL, and have created an initial version of a user-updated web calendar for a youth group I work with. I find this work extremely compelling; my desire to do more work like this is what inspired me to apply to the MSIE program.\nNearly all of my computer knowledge has been self-taught. While I continue to value learning from books and user-groups, I am eager to return to school, to immerse myself in learning about multiple aspects of Internet-engineering, from packet-transmission to programming and database environments. And I look forward to integrating this knowledge through the Capstone Project.\nI want to work on creative, interesting projects that would utilize this knowledge I will have gained. One vision is to work in a collegial environment such as Brown University in a technology-group setting where I could implement innovative, useful technology initiatives assisting students, faculty, and administrators.\nI have also been mulling over very preliminary ideas for a Capstone Project, ideas evolved from my early appreciation for how the Internet has created new possibilities for people to interact and work together. One example, stemming from an interest in alternative methods of voting and democracy, is to work with a political science professor at Brown to focus on a Rhode Island community to test Internet campaigning and voting (and to integrate into this experiment alternative voting strategies such as the 'single transferrable vote').\nI have a strong interest in policy decision-making and in improving systems. However, my primary goal is to directly build and create systems and solutions. This is why I am excited about applying to the MSIE program, and why I hope to be a part of The Persons School experience this Fall.\n—Birkin James Diana, MSIE applicant for Fall 2003\n\nThe group I was thinking about was the Scholarly Technology Group (STG) at Brown University. My understanding is that for a long time, it was part of the Brown's Computing &amp; Information Services department. I'd heard it operated in a cool way: it had a limited staff and budget; each year it would allow faculty to submit applications for STG to help bring-to-life a digital faculty web-project.\nIt recently became a part of the Brown Library, and I now work with these folk daily. \nWow.\n\n\"The Persons School\", named after Henry Z. Persons, was later renamed the \"The Marlboro College Graduate Center\".

Not just for youth, whose primary forms of non-voice digital communication are sms-texts or facebook-posts, but also for those of us for whom email is currently an absolutely essential daily form of communication.\nI believe it will be that significant.\nFor those not familiar with Google Wave, here are some links:\n\nwikipedia entry\nSince you really have to see it in action, here is an abridged version of the 1hr20min introduction\nThe main site\n\nMy mind-wheels have been spinning, envisioning what this new form of communication could impact.\nLibrary digital repository\nAt the Access 2007 conference I saw an inspiring talk by Mark Leggott of the University of Prince Edward Island. He spoke about the Virtual Research Environment that his group had created, which successfully addressed a thorny issue: Libraries which had  expended significant resources to build digital repository systems were having a terrible time getting campus entities to contribute content.\nWhat was so compelling about Leggott's approach was his team's shift in perspective from expecting users to meet Library requirements -- to the Library meeting users' needs. I was still fairly new to the Library world at that time, but my sense was that institutions had built their digital repository to meet Library needs for thorough meta-data -- without much regard to user-experience or needs. The result: the new digital repository felt irrelevant to campus users. With onerous submission processes and requirements, little material was submitted. Leggott's team instead focused directly on useful services to key campus constituents such as faculty -- allowing them to more easily do the work they already did. As I recall, one simple example was that his group provided storage space for research data-sets -- but I believe the offer wasn't just for final data-sets, but data-sets under active development, revision, and analysis. The result: campus digital work worthy of inclusion into the repository was already within the UPEI Library system, which made final repository ingestion of appropriate material architecturally easy.\nLayering\nNow that I have one work-foot in the digital repository world, I've been wondering about an issue stemming from my recollection of the Leggott team's approach: how to design a compelling suite of storage and easy-to-use services, without the Library repository being filled with vacation and pet pictures?\nMy thought: the Library could develop clear, simple policies for layers of repository-usage. The outer layer would be more flexible, more transactional, and would require a lower-level of quality metadata for submitted items -- tags would be fine. We already have a mission to support transactional, often non-archival work: supporting research. For items to be accepted into the inner more archival layer, more and higher quality metadata would be required, in exchange for the guarantee of permanence, multiple-channel data exposure, and format data-migration. The benefits of this layered approach: the Library can play an increased central role in the creative work of the campus, and ensure access to  quality data from across campus that would flow into the repository.\nFrom this layering idea arises the question of how to architecturally separate the layers. Brainstorming, I've imagined that campus users could be allotted x00 GB of outer-layer 'work' storage-space -- with more inner-layer repository-space just a click away for items deemed appropriate. Or the outer-layer work space could be limited by time-frame: all files in the outer-layer workspace could have, say, a two-year lifespan, with a nice status-report system so no one would lose work unexpectedly. That'd help encourage worthy materials to be migrated into the inner layer.\nLeveraging\nRecently, my thinking is shifting in a different direction. I still like the idea of an outer transactional work-layer, and an inner repository layer with richer metadata and higher archival guarantees. But I question whether we need to build all the outer-layer services. An alternate approach would be to facilitate the use of existing third-party services and tools, and build Library services, plugins, and widgets to streamline the ingestion of appropriate items from those external third-party work-layer services and tools.\nMy recent experimentation with Google Wave was a catalyst for this shift, especially given its collaborative strengths, and its ability to easily handle files and images via drag &amp; drop.\nVision\nOne of the use-cases we've envisioned for use of our digital repository is a professor organizing images for a class presentation. Imagine the professor is working with teaching assistants (TAs) to refine the presentation and associated points. With Google Wave, the professor could set up a wave to prepare for the class session. She could invite her two TAs into the wave; each could simply drag pictures into the wave, tagging them. The professor could also set up a bullet-point list in the wave, encourage the TAs to contribute to the bullet-list, and note issues for them to research in preparation for the class session.\nImagine if, when the session-material preparation is complete, the professor could then apply a Library repository-gadget to the wave which would, after a campus authentication process, ingest all the pictures and associated titles (and, optionally, the wave itself), and redirect the prof to a repository web-page to enter a bit more metadata. Upon adding this extra information, the data would be officially ingested into the repository. Because Google Wave is an open-source project, the Library or campus IT folk could, if desired, install a wave server to facilitate branding and make it all the easier for Libary services to be integrated seamlessly into users' work flow.\nGoogle wave comes with an Extensions Gallery that provides inspiration for imagining the varied kinds of services that can be applied to a wave, and tutorials abound on how to program extensions. The same approach could be applied to flickr and facebook: Library programmers could build widgets and mini-apps to enable users to use friendly tools and services they're already comfortable with -- but to still be able to shift their works easily into the official repository. It's part of the idea of meeting users where they are, as opposed to requiring that they come to us. That this approach offers new and exciting realms for Library programmers is just delicious gravy.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/the-wave-and-repository/","title":"the wave and the repository"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/trying-to-speak-icelandic/":{"body":"I and a good friend recently travelled for a week in Iceland. The landscapes, glaciers, caves, natural hot-springs, and waterfalls that Iceland is known for were, truly, incredible. But some of my fondest memories were of my interactions with Icelanders while trying out my very limited Icelandic.\nI've travelled in Italy, and have experienced Italians welcoming, and warmly embracing, my attempts to speak Italian -- but the shock and happiness of Icelanders took me by surprise.\nI've wondered about this... I'd estimate that two-thirds of the folk we met in restaurants and hotels did not speak Icelandic. Most were in their twenties, from other parts of Europe and especially Eastern Europe, working in Iceland for the summer, and all spoke English.\nSo perhaps part of the warm reaction I experienced was due to the fact that during the summer tourist season, many Icelanders have the odd experience of going to many places in their country where they will only be understood if they speak English.\nBut it could also simply be that the 330,000 Icelanders know theirs is a small country, that their language (an ancient form of Danish, I'm told) isn't spoken elsewhere, and that it is, by many accounts, more difficult to learn than many other European languages which are spoken by more people over a wider geographical area. And so perhaps they were simply appreciative that an effort was made.\nRegardless of the reason, the surprise and warmth I experienced was moving. A few minutes after checking in (in English) to a hotel with a nice restaurant at the other end of the room, I went back to the front desk, paused, and said in English, \"I'd like to try my poor Icelandic.\" Then I said, in Icelandic, \"I'd like to eat, over there, at seven-o'clock. Is that ok?\" The attendant looked at me blankly, and I said, in Icelandic, \"I'm American; yes, my Icelandic isn't very good.\" He slowly shook his head, then started speaking rapid Icelandic that I couldn't understand -- which I told him, in Icelandic. He then told me, in English, that no, I had spoken perfectly, which was why he was so surprised. He then took me over to the bartender, and asked me to repeat what I'd said. The bartender, then, called over a waitress, and asked me to repeat what I'd said.\nGreat conversations ensued each time this happened. And even when my attempts at Icelandic failed with the summer European workers, talking with them about their language experience was fascinating. I asked some of the Eastern Europeans: If they were to run into someone from another Eastern European country -- would their common language tend to be Russian? They said no, that for some folk in their parents' generation that would've been true, but all the young people spoke English. In fact, two different twenty-something Eastern Europeans said that growing up, they learn a dialect if from a small village -- and both their country's language and English -- and then for a foreign language they'll most commonly learn French or German or Russian. That's right -- that phrasing of English not being included in the listing of foreign languages is accurate.\nI'm cutting this post off here -- I've written more, about how I don't think of myself as very good at languages, despite what the above may imply. But I'll put those thoughts about learning languages in another post. To finish here, I'll just suggest that if you have even a passing interest in languages, and have a foreign trip coming up, take a stab at learning a bit of the language of the country you're visiting. Trying to do that stretches the mind; you're confronted with little conceptual shifts and subtle differences in thinking. For instance, in Icelandic, the shift from \"restaurant\" to \"the restaurant\" doesn't add another word, like in English or French or Spanish or Italian -- the word \"restaurant\" itself changes. Many of these shifts and mental challenges you'll feel but not understand. But that's ok -- that's exactly the attitude that can make your traveling experience richer and more rewarding.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/trying-to-speak-icelandic/","title":"trying to speak icelandic"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/unicode-normalization/":{"body":"The problem...\nYou feel you're on top of unicode, because all your database-data is encoded in utf-8, and your search-terms are encoded in utf-8, and internally you're decoding to unicode for everything -- all-good.

I also put up a wiki-page for the brainstorming process.\nThis stems from a requirement for a project: I had to be able to access a particular barcode related to a user. Turned out the only way of getting at this barcode was to first get another piece of information, and then use that first piece of information to call an API that returns a bunch of info about a user, including the barcode. Fine; did that; got the barcode and used it for a tunneler I built. I then went to the Access 2007 conference, a wonderful library programming/technology conference, where, among other terrific presentations, I heard Mark Leggot speak[*] about the repository presentation-PDF he set up at the University of Prince Edward Island (UPEI). He mentioned the importance of understanding a user's 'context'. Something clicked, and the general implications of what our team had achieved by being able to tie a user's log-in to this API-info about the user became clear.\nThis is nothing new in the internet business world; Amazon has been trailblazing this path for years.

There are varied bodies of thought as to how much a software product should be designed to meet 'future possible needs'.\nAt certain points in recent history, it may have been reasonable to design the sole interface to a system assuming that the user of the interface would be a person using a web-browser.\nThough APIs (application programming interface) have been around for ages, the trend toward programmers wanting to access internal and external systems via APIs has accelerated tremendously over the last few years.[*] As a programmer for a creative web-services department in a creative Library, I'm part of this trend. Our team's need to be able to programmatically access systems has increased dramatically. Fortunately, a few vendors such as Ex Libris understand this and have built possibilities for programmatic access into their products. But many closed systems remain.\nTo managers and directors making purchasing decisions, I urge that a top-level purchasing consideration be whether the vendor's product offers an API to the information it provides (in addition to any built-in web interface). The simple reason is that a web presentation of information is designed for a single purpose: for a user to interact with the system via a browser. An API allows the system's data to be accessed in any way we see fit, now or in the future.\nA concrete example for any reader not familiar with the notion of an API...\nOur team is currently developing a system to simplify the process of obtaining a book through interlibrary-loan services. In order to do this we have been able to automate the process of searching a consortial web-catalog for an item, and requesting that item. But the only method of doing this involves creating a program which essentially mimics a browser, automatically simulating clicked buttons and links and reading the resulting HTML of the consortial catalog's web interface.\nThis works, but is terribly fragile: if the design of a web-page changes, our program may no longer work until it is reconfigured to understand the new design.\nWhat we absolutely need (in addition to the existing web interface) is a catalog-service (the API) which would allow a defined http request to be sent to a URL that will allow a search to be performed, or an item to be requested, etc. (That http request would come from a program our team has written -- instead of from a user sitting at a browser.) Each request to this API would return predictable documented structured information (XML is one standard; there are others). Our team's program would then be able to automatically process this information.\nIt is worth emphasizing that I am not asking for a 'whole new program' from the catalog vendor. A system's existing internal program logic that produces the information for the regular web data-stream is applicable to production of the alternate API data-stream. Yes, it takes thought and work to create a good and secure API and document it -- but an API, essentially, presents the same data as a web interface, in a simpler format. The mind-shift in offering an API is often larger than the work-shift.\nFinally, about interacting with vendors regarding this issue... Vendor sales people aren't the developers, and it sounds like I am asking for something that vendor developers would be more knowledgeable about. But I've seen different vendor sales representatives at workshops and conferences, and the representatives for products that provide APIs have universally very clearly understood the importance of this issue. Thus if a product representative does not seem to understand this important feature, I would have significant concerns with the product.\n\nNotes...\n[*] Key aspects of this trend are articulated in the seminal article \"What Is Web 2.0 --\nDesign Patterns and Business Models for the Next Generation of Software\" by Tim O'Reilly.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/vendor-api-manifesto/","title":"Vendor API Manifesto"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/weighted-randomization/":{"body":"Many years ago one of my children hit a wall with Math in elementary school. He had always been bright, and quick to pick things up, so this was something of a surprise to him as well as to me. His class was in the early stages of learning multiplication, and it turned out that he had initially been able to add numbers in his head quickly enough that he hadn't needed to memorize the times-tables. This worked fine for him with lower numbers like 5x2, but began to break down pretty quickly with higher numbers like 9x7 and especially 23x76.\nFlashcard app\nSo I ended up doing something I had sworn I'd never do: I created a flashcard program on the computer to help him memorize his basic times-tables. I had always thought that using computer programs for rote memorization was a travesty -- knowing that computers could be used for interesting and mind-expanding purposes rather than boring, mind-numbing ones. But this became a fascinating project. I started out implementing it in FileMaker Pro, which I had begun using extensively for some database projects, and eventually reimplemented the program in REALbasic, a wonderful program (at least at the time; I haven't used it in years) that introduced me to object-oriented programming, and through the sheer elegance of its interface and structure nurtured my growing sense that programming was about Art in addition to Logic.\nIn addition to wanting to present a nice interface, I also knew that I wanted the questions presented to my son to flow in such a way that he would be quizzed more often on the questions he answered incorrectly, and less often on the ones he answered correctly. In any given work-session, I also wanted him to be able to work with a narrow slice of the whole set of 'difficult' problems so that he would perceive some sense of gaining mastery over material.\nTo clarify this last point, imagine a problem set of 10,000 questions, 5,000 of which are very easy, and 5,000 of which are very hard. Imagine you sit down to a 10-minute 'memorization-session'. If the program utilizes a very simple algorithm which chooses randomly from among the 5,000 difficult questions, chances are that after the 10 minutes you will have learned nothing and will be quite discouraged: you'll likely not have seen the same question twice, and you'll have answered everything wrong. This would be bad enough if you were an adult committed to learning the material, but if you were a kid in elementary school, this would be likely to crush any flickering desire to learn the material.\nAnd I wanted my program to be fun.\nDetails\nMy solution was to use what I call 'weighted-randomization'. Sometime I'll do a thorough search for the files I used those many years ago to see if I can find the code I created -- for posterity, amusement, and fond reflection. The basic idea consisted of two steps. First, from among all the... I guess 169 possible times-table queries (0x0 through 12x12), I chose a small subset: 10 as I recall, although eventually I made this number selectable via a preferences-pane (remember, I made this for a young kid, and assumed two 5-minute practice-sessions a day -- the latter one being optional but often completed because the app was fun). Second, I presented the queries. But of course the joy was in the details.\nFor the selection-step, my recollection is that I iterated through each possibility, and assigned it a 'selection-number', then sorted the list on selection-number and took the top 10. Before I describe the selection-number, I must first note that each possible query was initially assigned a 'score' of 0. When a query was answered correctly, the score was incremented; when answered incorrectly, the score was decremented. I eventually put the increment and decrement values into the app's preferences-pane to play around with their effect on the operation of the application, and as I recall usually had them set to increment correct answers by 1, and decrement incorrect answers by 2.\nSo why the selection-number rigamarole? Why not just sort on score, and take the 10 lowest numbers? That certainly would achieve the goal of presenting the user with the most-problematic problem-set. I did do that initially, but added the selection-number for two reasons. First, the simple presentation of only the hardest problems felt, well... boring. Second, I thought if I occasionally threw in some problems 'mostly' known, I would encourage crucial reinforcement to take place. And if one or two of the problem-set were 'easy', well, those queries' scores would rapidly increase and be less likely to be selected as part of the subset next time. Thus the selection-number. I don't remember the exact details, which I changed and experimented with extensively, but the basic idea: I took the lowest-score and the highest score, and split the range between them into, say, 10 equal segments. I then iterated through the queryset. For each score, I determined the segment it belonged to, then created a certain number of random-numbers, took the highest one, and assigned that as the selection-number. A more specific concrete example... Say the lowest score was -25 and the highest score was 5. That's a difference of 30. Splitting that into 10 segment-ranges yields segment ranges of 3 values. Thus the bottom segment-range would be -25 through -23, while the top segment would be 3 through 5. During the iteration step, if I came across -23 (in selection-range '10'), I would create '10' random numbers, and the highest one would become that query's selection-number. If I came across '3' (in selection-range '1'), I would create '1' random number; it would become that query's selection-number. Thus sorting then on selection-number and choosing the ten highest numbers would usually offer a subset of all queries consisting of mostly the hardest queries, mixed with some somewhat-hard queries, with an occasional easy query thrown in. Beautiful. Again, I don't remember the specific details, and do remember that I played frequently with the number of ranges and the number of random-numbers assigned for each range, but this description reflects the general approach to the slice-selection step.\nThe program was a hit, and did exactly what I had hoped; it helped my child memorize his times-tables. Shortly after I built it, I was immersed in learning Italian, and realized that with just a few tweaks this would be a terrific tool to help me memorize vocabulary. That also worked well, especially the ability to focus a review-sesion on a subset of all the words, because I built up a vocabulary set of hundreds of words. But abstracted from the tool, I kept ruminating on what made 'weighted-randomization' so compelling.\nThe idea\nThe concept binds together polar notions in a way that feels 'right'. Variety, as we've all heard, is the spice of life; morphing random-chance into likelihood offers possibilities for combining intentionality with variability to create joyful experience, as any gamer knows. The game Dungeons &amp; Dragons wonderfully codified realms of probability in spirals of detail useful to both the casual gamer and the addict: a strong character will be more 'likely' to defeat a weaker character, but more granularly, a particular delivery of a particular blow will be more or less likely to be successful based on the quality of the attacking weapon and the defending shield, the skill of the attacker and defender, etc. The varied dice used to calculate these percentages seem themselves talismans. But on a simpler level, any player of Risk or Backgammon perceives these same issues. The roll of the dice is pure chance, but the strength of one's position makes the outcome of a battle or game dependent on the same order-and-chance qualities embodied in weighted-randomization.\nMaking the world a better place\nI find it interesting to think about applying randomization to other systems. \nLifeBalance is a wonderful little to-do list program I miss using since I gave up my Palm for an iPhone. I don't have direct knowledge of its internals, but I suspect it incorporates weighted-randomization in it's preparation of one's task-list. One part of the program offers the ability to define broad areas of life (i.e. work, maintaining friendships, family-life, etc.) and assign a rough percentage of time one would ideally like to devote to each area. Since to-do tasks end up being subsets of these areas, and since each task can be assigned a rough amount of time it will take to accomplish, the program tracks how much time is actually being expended in the broad areas, and optionally adjusts the current to-do list to maintain the preferred balance. The result is that there may be occasions in which a task of a slightly lower priority can appear higher on a to-do list than a task with a higher priority, if the lower-priority task will better-serve the less-immediate goal of achieving the life-area balance specified. This approach could conceivably be implemented using algorithms that don't utilize weighted-randomization, but this is just the kind of situation that weighted-randomization would be good for -- injecting a bit of flexibility into a system while still maintaining overall goals.\nAs a final thought experiment, imagine possibilities for injecting weighted-randomization into political systems.\nI have a vague memory from a college class, likely jumbled by time, of hearing that in 15th Florence, a cohort of possible city-council leaders was chosen from among the populace much like those chosen for jury-duty today. As I recall, each individual in the cohort was then voted on by the populace, but only whether the individual was fit to serve: a yes or no vote. If a person received enough yes-votes, his name was put into a hat from which the new leaders were drawn at random. This unusual form of weighted-randomization suggests that when injected into political systems, it might reduce corrupting influences and by inference improve quality. Usually, and reasonably, years-of-service or merit-evaluations or test-scores are the institutional barriers to corruption. Weighted-randomization could be another tool worth exploring.\nImagine that of all bills a legislative committee debates publicly, 80% are selected for debate according to usual political processes, and 20% via a weighted-randomization scheme akin to my math flash-card program (i.e., perhaps a manual ranking of preference followed by randomizations based on those rankings). Obviously no one would want chance to factor into whether a bill actually becomes law, but since so many good ideas die for want of being scheduled for committee debate (often for questionable political reasons), injecting a bit of weighted-randomization into such a process could be a good thing, certainly worth trying.\nI may add to this post other realms in which weighted-randomization might offer systemic improvements. Feel free to suggest ideas; I may post a few of them here.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/weighted-randomization/","title":"weighted randomization"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/youth-and-library-technology/":{"body":"In late September I saw an announcement about a computer science talk which referred to an acronym I wasn’t familiar with: CS4RI. A bit of googling led to the organization 'CS4RI: Computer Science for Rhode Island'. Its website included a link to their 'CS4RI Summit 2016', which stated as a goal: \"The CS4RI Summit aims to inspire the next generation of computer scientists, entrepreneurs, and engaged tech sector employees… let’s excite students with the many educational and career opportunities that result from studying CS…\"\nOur Digital Technologes department is a vibrant place to work. We combine focused productivity with a culture of learning about new technologies and practices. And Libraries at our peer institutions are also known to be terrific places to work.\nIt occurred to me that while CS middle and high-school students would suspect that robotics or game-design organizations could be interesting places to work — they’d very likely never think that Libraries could be worth considering. A few of us set out to remedy that; we reserved an exhibit-table at the CS4RI Summit held at the University of Rhode Island on December 14, 2016.\nIt was a wonderful event. All sorts of interesting tech companies and organizations exhibited for some 1,500 students. At our exhibit, we talked about how Amazon and Google set the bar for making things easy to find, and easy to get — and how Libraries have worked hard to improve the discoverability and accessibility of our services. We shared that we’ve hired and are continuing to hire people with computer-science and other technology backgrounds. We noted that our Digital Technologies team gets to partner with researchers working on all sorts of interesting issues and technologies. And we let students know we work with, and contribute to, open-source technologies so that our work benefits not only our users, but a much wider community of learners.\nA few hundreds of middle and high-schoolers now have some awareness that Libraries are worth considering for working with technology in a variety of creative, dynamic, and rewarding ways.\n(For making this possible and successful, thanks to Bruce Boucek, Hector Correa, Jean Rainwater, Kerri Hicks, Patrick Rashleigh, and Shashi Mishra.)\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/youth-and-library-technology/","title":"high-schoolers: technology in the library"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/":{"body":17,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/art-of-testing/":{"body":344,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/benign-neglect-opportunities/":{"body":418,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/birth-tips/":{"body":371,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/campus-api-ideas/":{"body":732,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/dashboard-initiative/":{"body":500,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/debouncing-explained/":{"body":101,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/discovery-tools-standards-trends/":{"body":568,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/django-42-lts/":{"body":33,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/django-templates/":{"body":303,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/i-love-hate-python-docstrings-for-testing/":{"body":199,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/installing-wireshark/":{"body":2695,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/moving-code-onto-network/":{"body":216,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/nice-soa-implementation/":{"body":366,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/non-tesla-charging-challenges/":{"body":416,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/ok-again-to-buy-non-teslas/":{"body":393,"title":6},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/polyphasic-sleep/":{"body":74,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/querydict-params/":{"body":237,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/recursion/":{"body":322,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/shib-and-fedora/":{"body":562,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/ssh-tunneling-notes/":{"body":647,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/statement/":{"body":471,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/the-wave-and-repository/":{"body":637,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/trying-to-speak-icelandic/":{"body":359,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/unicode-normalization/":{"body":373,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/unicode-urls/":{"body":123,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/user-context/":{"body":155,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/vendor-api-manifesto/":{"body":371,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/weighted-randomization/":{"body":1037,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/youth-and-library-technology/":{"body":207,"title":4}},"length":31},"lang":"English"};
