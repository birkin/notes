        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;That title sounds a bit odd, doesn&#x27;t it.  ðŸ™‚ &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a father of two, I&#x27;ve had occasion, over the years, to offer my &#x27;three tips&#x27; to first-time moms-to-be, and have received positive feedback. Recently I&#x27;ve been thinking about birth due to recent family and friend births, and figured I&#x27;d write them up...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;childbirth-classes&quot;&gt;Childbirth classes&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Think of tips &amp;amp; techniques as tools, not rules.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;highly recommend&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; childbirth classes; I really cannot say enough positive things about them -- even refresher ones. However, my advice for moms (and partners): view the tips and techniques taught as &#x27;possible tools&#x27;, not &#x27;rules to live up to&#x27;. Specific moms may or may not find specific tips and techniques useful. The reason I note this is because I&#x27;ve occasionally talked to moms who have been disappointed with their &#x27;performance&#x27; during birth -- often because they had an expectation from a class of how the birth &#x27;should have&#x27; progressed. One mom told me she was embarrassed at how loud she was, thinking that if she would have performed the class&#x27; breathing and relaxation techniques &#x27;better&#x27;, she wouldn&#x27;t have needed to yell. My thought: if yelling or grunting works for a particular woman -- that is &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, whether or not it is in any standard technique playbook.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;visitors&quot;&gt;Visitors&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pick a close friend or family member to &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;not&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; visit until after four weeks have elapsed.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is mostly for the first kid. It comes from a midwife, and was dramatically confirmed by our experience with our firstborn. She told us that after the child is born, friends and family will, understandably, want to come and visit and help out. By the time a month has elapsed, everyone has come and gone, and &lt;em&gt;that&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is when the effects of sleeplessness can become more pronounced, and help is most appreciated&#x2F;needed. Based on this, we planned to have one of our good friends fly in around five weeks after the birth of our first child. Our baby was colicky until about six weeks, and our friend&#x27;s simple willingness to do laundry, to organize pizza deliveries, and to simply watch the baby while we both took a short walk was deeply, deeply appreciated.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;breastfeeding&quot;&gt;Breastfeeding&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&#x27;s not innate! Learn, and ask for advice.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that in times when multiple generations of families commonly lived together, or for those women who have had a baby &lt;em&gt;after&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; a bunch of their women friends have, this fact would not be the surprise that it was to us. However, we were among the first of our set of friends to have children, and so hadn&#x27;t had the experience of extensive conversations.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had naively assumed that breastfeeding would be some sort of natural, somewhat instinctive process, but our midwife encouraged us to go to a breastfeeding class. The instructor basically noted that given that our society is no longer made up of multi-generational families living together, many are not aware that the process can be difficult for mom and baby to get used to. In particular, she noted that because first-time moms are understandably concerned about the baby, that it&#x27;s easy for an unconstructive cycle to quickly develop: mom is worried that baby isn&#x27;t getting enough milk -&amp;gt; feedings thus become more stressful -&amp;gt; feedings thus become more difficult -&amp;gt; mom worries more. The instructor showed the (clothed) moms helpful holding techniques, gave information about dealing with sore nipples (and noted how commonly that condition occurs among first-time moms especially), and gave a hotline number for information and support and even a home-visit for a bit of coaching. For us, breastfeeding mostly went smoothly for mom &amp;amp; baby, but during a few difficult periods, the information and the normalization of the problem from that class was &lt;em&gt;invaluable&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. (I trust that it&#x27;s not even necessary here to spend any time noting &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.healthychildren.org&#x2F;english&#x2F;ages-stages&#x2F;baby&#x2F;breastfeeding&#x2F;pages&#x2F;Why-Breastfeed.aspx&quot;&gt;why breastfeeding is a Good Thing&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time we had our second baby a few years later, I noticed, in our brief hospital stay, much more information being offered about breastfeeding tips and techniques. I hope information this trend has continued. Congrats to all parents-to-be out there!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <id>https://bspace.us/posts/weighted-randomization/</id>
        
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Many years ago one of my children hit a wall with Math in elementary school. He had always been bright, and quick to pick things up, so this was something of a surprise to him as well as to me. His class was in the early stages of learning multiplication, and it turned out that he had initially been able to add numbers in his head quickly enough that he hadn&#x27;t needed to memorize the times-tables. This worked fine for him with lower numbers like 5x2, but began to break down pretty quickly with higher numbers like 9x7 and especially 23x76.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;flashcard-app&quot;&gt;Flashcard app&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I ended up doing something I had sworn I&#x27;d never do: I created a flashcard program on the computer to help him memorize his basic times-tables. I had always thought that using computer programs for rote memorization was a travesty -- knowing that computers could be used for interesting and mind-expanding purposes rather than boring, mind-numbing ones. But this became a fascinating project. I started out implementing it in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Filemaker_Pro&quot;&gt;FileMaker Pro&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which I had begun using extensively for some database projects, and eventually reimplemented the program in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;REALbasic&quot;&gt;REALbasic&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a wonderful program (at least at the time; I haven&#x27;t used it in years) that introduced me to object-oriented programming, and through the sheer elegance of its interface and structure nurtured my growing sense that programming was about Art in addition to Logic.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to wanting to present a nice interface, I also knew that I wanted the questions presented to my son to flow in such a way that he would be quizzed more often on the questions he answered incorrectly, and less often on the ones he answered correctly. In any given work-session, I also wanted him to be able to work with a narrow slice of the whole set of &#x27;difficult&#x27; problems so that he would perceive some sense of gaining mastery over material.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To clarify this last point, imagine a problem set of 10,000 questions, 5,000 of which are very easy, and 5,000 of which are very hard. Imagine you sit down to a 10-minute &#x27;memorization-session&#x27;. If the program utilizes a very simple algorithm which chooses &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Randomness&quot;&gt;randomly&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; from among the 5,000 difficult questions, chances are that after the 10 minutes you will have learned nothing and will be quite discouraged: you&#x27;ll likely not have seen the same question twice, and you&#x27;ll have answered everything wrong. This would be bad enough if you were an adult committed to learning the material, but if you were a kid in elementary school, this would be likely to crush any flickering desire to learn the material.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I wanted my program to be fun.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;details&quot;&gt;Details&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My solution was to use what I call &#x27;weighted-randomization&#x27;. Sometime I&#x27;ll do a thorough search for the files I used those many years ago to see if I can find the code I created -- for posterity, amusement, and fond reflection. The basic idea consisted of two steps. First, from among all the... I guess 169 possible times-table queries (0x0 through 12x12), I chose a small subset: 10 as I recall, although eventually I made this number selectable via a preferences-pane (remember, I made this for a young kid, and assumed two 5-minute practice-sessions a day -- the latter one being optional but often completed because the app was fun). Second, I presented the queries. But of course the joy was in the details.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the selection-step, my recollection is that I iterated through each possibility, and assigned it a &#x27;selection-number&#x27;, then sorted the list on selection-number and took the top 10. Before I describe the selection-number, I must first note that each possible query was initially assigned a &#x27;score&#x27; of 0. When a query was answered correctly, the score was incremented; when answered incorrectly, the score was decremented. I eventually put the increment and decrement values into the app&#x27;s preferences-pane to play around with their effect on the operation of the application, and as I recall usually had them set to increment correct answers by 1, and decrement incorrect answers by 2.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why the selection-number rigamarole? Why not just sort on score, and take the 10 lowest numbers? That certainly would achieve the goal of presenting the user with the most-problematic problem-set. I did do that initially, but added the selection-number for two reasons. First, the simple presentation of only the hardest problems felt, well... boring. Second, I thought if I occasionally threw in some problems &#x27;mostly&#x27; known, I would encourage crucial reinforcement to take place. And if one or two of the problem-set were &#x27;easy&#x27;, well, those queries&#x27; scores would rapidly increase and be less likely to be selected as part of the subset next time. Thus the selection-number. I don&#x27;t remember the exact details, which I changed and experimented with extensively, but the basic idea: I took the lowest-score and the highest score, and split the range between them into, say, 10 equal segments. I then iterated through the queryset. For each score, I determined the segment it belonged to, then created a certain number of random-numbers, took the highest one, and assigned that as the selection-number. A more specific concrete example... Say the lowest score was -25 and the highest score was 5. That&#x27;s a difference of 30. Splitting that into 10 segment-ranges yields segment ranges of 3 values. Thus the bottom segment-range would be -25 through -23, while the top segment would be 3 through 5. During the iteration step, if I came across -23 (in selection-range &#x27;10&#x27;), I would create &#x27;10&#x27; random numbers, and the highest one would become that query&#x27;s selection-number. If I came across &#x27;3&#x27; (in selection-range &#x27;1&#x27;), I would create &#x27;1&#x27; random number; it would become that query&#x27;s selection-number. Thus sorting then on selection-number and choosing the ten highest numbers would usually offer a subset of all queries consisting of mostly the hardest queries, mixed with some somewhat-hard queries, with an occasional easy query thrown in. Beautiful. Again, I don&#x27;t remember the specific details, and do remember that I played frequently with the number of ranges and the number of random-numbers assigned for each range, but this description reflects the general approach to the slice-selection step.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program was a hit, and did exactly what I had hoped; it helped my child memorize his times-tables. Shortly after I built it, I was immersed in learning Italian, and realized that with just a few tweaks this would be a terrific tool to help me memorize vocabulary. That also worked well, especially the ability to focus a review-sesion on a subset of all the words, because I built up a vocabulary set of hundreds of words. But abstracted from the tool, I kept ruminating on what made &#x27;weighted-randomization&#x27; so compelling.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-idea&quot;&gt;The idea&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept binds together polar notions in a way that feels &#x27;right&#x27;. Variety, as we&#x27;ve all heard, is the spice of life; morphing random-chance into likelihood offers possibilities for combining intentionality with variability to create joyful experience, as any gamer knows. The game &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dungeons_and_dragons&quot;&gt;Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; wonderfully codified realms of probability in spirals of detail useful to both the casual gamer and the addict: a strong character will be more &#x27;likely&#x27; to defeat a weaker character, but more granularly, a particular delivery of a particular blow will be more or less likely to be successful based on the quality of the attacking weapon and the defending shield, the skill of the attacker and defender, etc. The &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dice#Non-cubical_dice&quot;&gt;varied dice&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; used to calculate these percentages seem themselves talismans. But on a simpler level, any player of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Risk_%28game%29&quot;&gt;Risk&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Backgammon&quot;&gt;Backgammon&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; perceives these same issues. The roll of the dice is pure chance, but the strength of one&#x27;s position makes the outcome of a battle or game dependent on the same order-and-chance qualities embodied in weighted-randomization.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;making-the-world-a-better-place&quot;&gt;Making the world a better place&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it interesting to think about applying randomization to other systems. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20080830093825&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.llamagraphics.com&#x2F;LB&#x2F;index.php&quot;&gt;LifeBalance&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a wonderful little to-do list program I miss using since I gave up my Palm for an &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;iphone&#x2F;&quot;&gt;iPhone&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I don&#x27;t have direct knowledge of its internals, but I suspect it incorporates weighted-randomization in it&#x27;s preparation of one&#x27;s task-list. One part of the program offers the ability to define broad areas of life (i.e. work, maintaining friendships, family-life, etc.) and assign a rough percentage of time one would ideally like to devote to each area. Since to-do tasks end up being subsets of these areas, and since each task can be assigned a rough amount of time it will take to accomplish, the program tracks how much time is &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; being expended in the broad areas, and optionally adjusts the current to-do list to maintain the preferred balance. The result is that there may be occasions in which a task of a slightly lower priority can appear higher on a to-do list than a task with a higher priority, if the lower-priority task will better-serve the less-immediate goal of achieving the life-area balance specified. This approach could conceivably be implemented using algorithms that don&#x27;t utilize weighted-randomization, but this is just the kind of situation that weighted-randomization would be good for -- injecting a bit of flexibility into a system while still maintaining overall goals.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a final thought experiment, imagine possibilities for injecting weighted-randomization into political systems.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a vague memory from a college class, likely jumbled by time, of hearing that in 15th Florence, a cohort of possible city-council leaders was chosen from among the populace much like those chosen for jury-duty today. As I recall, each individual in the cohort was then voted on by the populace, but only whether the individual was fit to serve: a yes or no vote. If a person received enough yes-votes, his name was put into a hat from which the new leaders were drawn at random. This unusual form of weighted-randomization suggests that when injected into political systems, it might reduce corrupting influences and by inference improve quality. Usually, and reasonably, years-of-service or merit-evaluations or test-scores are the institutional barriers to corruption. Weighted-randomization could be another tool worth exploring.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine that of all bills a legislative committee debates publicly, 80% are selected for debate according to usual political processes, and 20% via a weighted-randomization scheme akin to my math flash-card program (i.e., perhaps a manual ranking of preference followed by randomizations based on those rankings). Obviously no one would want chance to factor into whether a bill actually becomes law, but since so many good ideas die for want of being scheduled for committee debate (often for questionable political reasons), injecting a bit of weighted-randomization into such a process could be a good thing, certainly worth trying.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may add to this post other realms in which weighted-randomization might offer systemic improvements. Feel free to suggest ideas; I may post a few of them here.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <id>https://bspace.us/posts/statement/</id>
        
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just today ran a disk-search on some text and saw an old &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;AppleWorks&quot;&gt;ClarisWorks&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;-format file named &amp;quot;statement&amp;quot; that, curious, I opened. It&#x27;s a statement that was part of my application to the &lt;em&gt;Masters of Science in Internet Engineering&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; program of &amp;quot;The Person&#x27;s School of Marlboro College&amp;quot;[*], the graduate school of Marlboro College. The eighth paragraph, where I conveyed a sense of what I would like to do in the future, struck me; I hadn&#x27;t remembered writing it. Interesting how life works out...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For over fifteen years I have been captivated by the way in which computers have created possibilities for people to work together. In the 1980s I attached a 300-baud modem to my first Mac, and discovered a world of local bulletin-board systems as well as a national service called GEnie. Though GEnie used a text interface, it hosted a game which allowed members to engage in aerial combat via downloaded software. I was fascinated by this union of a graphical front-end to underlying networking.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interest in computers connecting people led me to create a local BBS I ran for two years which focused on social change issues and introducing non-technical folk to the benefits of email and discussion groups.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My immersion in the design and logic of BBS-hosting software primed my move from desktop publishing to database programming. I created a discussion area on America Online (the &#x27;FoxBASE&#x2F;Mac Coffeehouse&#x27;) devoted to the exchange of tips and techniques, and learned first-hand how powerful a learning tool a national network can be. It was during this intensive period of dBASE programming, working on a series of complex multi-user systems, that I learned programming constructs (memory variables, loops, conditional branching, etc.) that have proven invaluable to this day. I have since created a few small educational programs using REALbasic, an object-oriented programming environment similar to Visual Basic.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For years I have dabbled with web-page creation, but my interest in the web has grown significantly as I have begun to experiment with moving beyond static pages.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My first dynamic web project was the creation of an automated script that twice a day exported data from multiple office databases to text-files, massaged these files in a text-editor, and then uploaded them to a webserver where the new data was displayed via server-side-includes. Exciting, but still not interactive.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Over the past year, I have begun to learn PHP and MySQL, and have created an initial version of a user-updated web calendar for a youth group I work with. I find this work extremely compelling; my desire to do more work like this is what inspired me to apply to the MSIE program.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nearly all of my computer knowledge has been self-taught. While I continue to value learning from books and user-groups, I am eager to return to school, to immerse myself in learning about multiple aspects of Internet-engineering, from packet-transmission to programming and database environments. And I look forward to integrating this knowledge through the Capstone Project.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I want to work on creative, interesting projects that would utilize this knowledge I will have gained. One vision is to work in a collegial environment such as Brown University in a technology-group setting where I could implement innovative, useful technology initiatives assisting students, faculty, and administrators.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have also been mulling over very preliminary ideas for a Capstone Project, ideas evolved from my early appreciation for how the Internet has created new possibilities for people to interact and work together. One example, stemming from an interest in alternative methods of voting and democracy, is to work with a political science professor at Brown to focus on a Rhode Island community to test Internet campaigning and voting (and to integrate into this experiment alternative voting strategies such as the &#x27;single transferrable vote&#x27;).&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have a strong interest in policy decision-making and in improving systems. However, my primary goal is to directly build and create systems and solutions. This is why I am excited about applying to the MSIE program, and why I hope to be a part of The Persons School experience this Fall.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;â€”Birkin James Diana, MSIE applicant for Fall 2003&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group I was thinking about was the &lt;em&gt;Scholarly Technology Group (STG)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; at Brown University. My understanding is that for a long time, it was part of the Brown&#x27;s Computing &amp;amp; Information Services department. I&#x27;d heard it operated in a cool way: it had a limited staff and budget; each year it would allow faculty to submit applications for STG to help bring-to-life a digital faculty web-project.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It recently became a part of the Brown Library, and I now work with these folk daily. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Persons School&amp;quot;, named after &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;1978&#x2F;01&#x2F;08&#x2F;archives&#x2F;obituary-6-no-title.html&quot;&gt;Henry Z. Persons&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, was later renamed the &amp;quot;The Marlboro College Graduate Center&amp;quot;. &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Marlboro_College&quot;&gt;Marlboro College&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; has since closed; in 2020 it was incorporated into Emerson College.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
