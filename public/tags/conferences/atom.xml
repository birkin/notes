        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In late September I saw an announcement about a computer science talk which referred to an acronym I wasn’t familiar with: CS4RI. A bit of googling led to the organization &#x27;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs4ri.org&quot;&gt;CS4RI: Computer Science for Rhode Island&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&#x27;. Its website included a link to their &#x27;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs4ri.org&#x2F;summit&quot;&gt;CS4RI Summit 2016&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&#x27;, which stated as a goal: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;The CS4RI Summit aims to inspire the next generation of computer scientists, entrepreneurs, and engaged tech sector employees… let’s excite students with the many educational and career opportunities that result from studying CS…&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Digital Technologes department is a vibrant place to work. We combine focused productivity with a culture of learning about new technologies and practices. And Libraries at our peer institutions are also known to be terrific places to work.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It occurred to me that while CS middle and high-school students would suspect that robotics or game-design organizations could be interesting places to work — they’d very likely never think that Libraries could be worth considering. A few of us set out to remedy that; we reserved an exhibit-table at the CS4RI Summit held at the University of Rhode Island on December 14, 2016.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a wonderful event. All sorts of interesting tech companies and organizations exhibited for some 1,500 students. At our exhibit, we talked about how Amazon and Google set the bar for making things easy to find, and easy to get — and how Libraries have worked hard to improve the discoverability and accessibility of our services. We shared that we’ve hired and are continuing to hire people with computer-science and other technology backgrounds. We noted that our Digital Technologies team gets to partner with researchers working on all sorts of interesting issues and technologies. And we let students know we work with, and contribute to, open-source technologies so that our work benefits not only our users, but a much wider community of learners.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few hundreds of middle and high-schoolers now have some awareness that Libraries are worth considering for working with technology in a variety of creative, dynamic, and rewarding ways.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For making this possible and successful, thanks to Bruce Boucek, Hector Correa, Jean Rainwater, Kerri Hicks, Patrick Rashleigh, and Shashi Mishra.)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <id>https://bspace.us/posts/benign-neglect-opportunities/</id>
        
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cathy_Marshall_(hypertext_developer)&quot;&gt;Cathy Marshall&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of Microsoft Research gave a keynote at the wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;code4lib.org&#x2F;conference&#x2F;2010&#x2F;&quot;&gt;code4lib 2010 conference&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that provided a useful nudge to my thinking about repository layers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve suggested &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bspace.us&#x2F;posts&#x2F;the-wave-and-repository&#x2F;&quot;&gt;elsewhere&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that university libraries contemplating a repository should consider developing policies around repository &#x27;layers&#x27;. This notion involves both an inner long-term, high-guarantee archival layer -- and an outer services-oriented work-space layer. Reasons for the archival layer are obvious. Perhaps less so are reasons for and benefits of the work-space layer: it fulfills a library mission to further scholarly work; it strengthens the library&#x27;s position as a central part of the academic campus community; it creates opportunities for valuable work to be moved easily into the archival layer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though my Library doesn&#x27;t conceptualize our repository in this way, it&#x27;s compelling enough that I think about this layered approach regularly. Given some exciting video initiatives at my University, much of my recent work-space layer thinking has focused on how to avoid the possibility of having precious library disk space overwhelmed with hypothetical services-layer low(er) quality materials. Strategies I&#x27;ve considered to deal with this concern are combinations of limiting the size of an entity&#x27;s (person&#x2F;department) work-space, and&#x2F;or limiting the number of years items may remain in the work-space. Given my strong belief in providing useful and friendly user-services, in this &#x27;limiting&#x27; scenario, we would provide terrific charts and notifications which would allow work-space users to easily monitor their usage of this temporal, useful space -- and provide tools and Library staff assistance to easily move appropriate items into the archival layer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But regardless of the intention to have this work-space be used productively, there would be a high likelihood that the more control we give users over their Library work-space, the more likely that a significant portion of this work-space would fill up with materials that exist simply because it&#x27;s more of a hassle to delete things than it is to neglect them -- one of Marshall&#x27;s key points.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Marshall specifically noted the problems of benign-neglect as a user-strategy for handling materials, she also noted that benign neglect offers opportunities. This was the nudge. I&#x27;m finding this notion of opportunities fascinating to reflect upon; it offers new realms for thinking about interesting services that could be built for this work-space layer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simple accretion of data from benign neglect suggests the now-common mining strategy associated with usage-data, popularized by amazon: &amp;quot;you may also be interested in this&amp;quot;. A colleague recently told me about &#x27;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinyurl.com&#x2F;y8oowqa&quot;&gt;mallet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&#x27;, software than can mine texts to discern topics. It would be a worthy experiment to use such a tool to offer repository users an optional discovery service based on their text-based work-space materials.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two additions to Apple&#x27;s iPhoto application in the last year or so suggest other possibilities. &#x27;Faces&#x27; scans a user&#x27;s iPhoto library, using pattern-recognition routines to create groupings of people. &#x27;Places&#x27; scan&#x27;s the library and extracts geo-location coordinates if available, and, if I recall correctly, timestamp data, to create a map view over time of photo-locations.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other scans could be run on work-space data, looking for patterns of government data-sets or citations. And &lt;em&gt;combinations&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; of embedded metadata such as geo-location and mime-type and date could be gathered, so that if, for example, a pattern of images taken at a certain location on a certain date was detected, not only could auto-grouping of those items be presented, but external sources such as flickr could be queried as well, offering the user the ability to see other external views of this &#x27;event&#x27;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these scan&#x2F;mining ideas would also be useful to apply to the repository as a whole. Such scans could offer both automated randomized general-discovery displays, as well as offer researchers additional focused discovery-views to permitted items. But to the extent that such services enhance the quality of users&#x27; work-space experience, it might help to keep the materials in the work-space more relevant: using benign-neglect to minimize benign-neglect.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <id>https://bspace.us/posts/the-wave-and-repository/</id>
        
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve been playing with &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wave.google.com&quot;&gt;Google Wave&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; recently and am deeply impressed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would not be surprised if within a few years, a year for many, waves will largely replace emails. Not just for youth, whose primary forms of non-voice digital communication are sms-texts or facebook-posts, but also for those of us for whom email is currently an absolutely essential daily form of communication.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe it will be that significant.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those not familiar with Google Wave, here are some links:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Google_Wave&quot;&gt;wikipedia entry&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since you really have to see it in action, &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Itc4253kjhw&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is an abridged version of the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=v_UyVmITiYQ&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded&quot;&gt;1hr20min introduction&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wave.google.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;main site&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mind-wheels have been spinning, envisioning what this new form of communication could impact.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;library-digital-repository&quot;&gt;Library digital repository&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;access2007.uvic.ca&#x2F;?page_id=18&quot;&gt;Access 2007&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; conference I saw an &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;video.google.ca&#x2F;videoplay?docid=6976320823933843470&amp;amp;hl=en-CA#&quot;&gt;inspiring talk&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; by Mark Leggott of the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.upei.ca&#x2F;&quot;&gt;University of Prince Edward Island&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. He spoke about the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vre2.upei.ca&#x2F;access2009&#x2F;vre&quot;&gt;Virtual Research Environment&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that his group had created, which successfully addressed a thorny issue: Libraries which had  expended significant resources to build digital repository systems were having a terrible time getting campus entities to contribute content.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was so compelling about Leggott&#x27;s approach was his team&#x27;s shift in perspective from expecting users to meet Library requirements -- to the Library meeting users&#x27; needs. I was still fairly new to the Library world at that time, but my sense was that institutions had built their digital repository to meet Library needs for thorough meta-data -- without much regard to user-experience or needs. The result: the new digital repository felt irrelevant to campus users. With onerous submission processes and requirements, little material was submitted. Leggott&#x27;s team instead focused directly on useful services to key campus constituents such as faculty -- allowing them to more easily do the work they already did. As I recall, one simple example was that his group provided storage space for research data-sets -- but I believe the offer wasn&#x27;t just for &lt;em&gt;final&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; data-sets, but data-sets under active development, revision, and analysis. The result: campus digital work worthy of inclusion into the repository was &lt;em&gt;already within&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; the UPEI Library system, which made final repository ingestion of appropriate material architecturally easy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;layering&quot;&gt;Layering&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I have one work-foot in the digital repository world, I&#x27;ve been wondering about an issue stemming from my recollection of the Leggott team&#x27;s approach: how to design a compelling suite of storage and easy-to-use services, without the Library repository being filled with vacation and pet pictures?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My thought: the Library could develop clear, simple policies for &lt;em&gt;layers&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; of repository-usage. The outer layer would be more flexible, more transactional, and would require a lower-level of quality metadata for submitted items -- tags would be fine. We already have a mission to support transactional, often non-archival work: supporting research. For items to be accepted into the inner more archival layer, more and higher quality metadata would be required, in exchange for the guarantee of permanence, multiple-channel data exposure, and format data-migration. The benefits of this layered approach: the Library can play an increased central role in the creative work of the campus, and ensure access to  quality data from across campus that would flow into the repository.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this layering idea arises the question of how to architecturally separate the layers. Brainstorming, I&#x27;ve imagined that campus users could be allotted x00 GB of outer-layer &#x27;work&#x27; storage-space -- with more inner-layer repository-space just a click away for items deemed appropriate. Or the outer-layer work space could be limited by time-frame: all files in the outer-layer workspace could have, say, a two-year lifespan, with a nice status-report system so no one would lose work unexpectedly. That&#x27;d help encourage worthy materials to be migrated into the inner layer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;leveraging&quot;&gt;Leveraging&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, my thinking is shifting in a different direction. I still like the idea of an outer transactional work-layer, and an inner repository layer with richer metadata and higher archival guarantees. But I question whether we need to build all the outer-layer services. An alternate approach would be to facilitate the use of existing third-party services and tools, and build Library services, plugins, and widgets to streamline the ingestion of appropriate items from those external third-party work-layer services and tools.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My recent experimentation with Google Wave was a catalyst for this shift, especially given its collaborative strengths, and its ability to easily handle files and images via drag &amp;amp; drop.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;vision&quot;&gt;Vision&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the use-cases we&#x27;ve envisioned for use of our digital repository is a professor organizing images for a class presentation. Imagine the professor is working with teaching assistants (TAs) to refine the presentation and associated points. With Google Wave, the professor could set up a wave to prepare for the class session. She could invite her two TAs into the wave; each could simply drag pictures into the wave, tagging them. The professor could also set up a bullet-point list in the wave, encourage the TAs to contribute to the bullet-list, and note issues for them to research in preparation for the class session.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine if, when the session-material preparation is complete, the professor could then apply a Library repository-gadget to the wave which would, after a campus authentication process, ingest all the pictures and associated titles (and, optionally, the wave itself), and redirect the prof to a repository web-page to enter a bit more metadata. Upon adding this extra information, the data would be officially ingested into the repository. Because Google Wave is an open-source project, the Library or campus IT folk could, if desired, install a wave server to facilitate branding and make it all the easier for Libary services to be integrated seamlessly into users&#x27; work flow.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google wave comes with an &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wave.google.com&#x2F;help&#x2F;wave&#x2F;extensions.html&quot;&gt;Extensions&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; Gallery that provides inspiration for imagining the varied kinds of services that can be applied to a wave, and tutorials abound on &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;googlewavedev.blogspot.com&#x2F;2009&#x2F;05&#x2F;introducing-google-wave-apis-what-can.html&quot;&gt;how to program extensions&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The same approach could be applied to flickr and facebook: Library programmers could build widgets and mini-apps to enable users to use friendly tools and services they&#x27;re already comfortable with -- but to still be able to shift their works easily into the official repository. It&#x27;s part of the idea of meeting users where they are, as opposed to requiring that they come to us. That this approach offers new and exciting realms for Library programmers is just delicious gravy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Got a nice little blog-recognition email a couple weeks ago by a reader asking if I would write up a report on this NISO conference for possible inclusion in a newsletter. Here&#x27;s the web-version.]&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirteen presentations were given at the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.niso.org&#x2F;home&quot;&gt;NISO&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; Forum &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.niso.org&#x2F;events&#x2F;2008&#x2F;03&#x2F;next-generation-discovery-tools-new-tools-aging-standards&quot;&gt;&#x27;Next Generation Discovery: New Tools, Aging Standards&#x27;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, held on March 27 and 28, 2008, in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. They covered three main areas: current user-expectations, discovery tools attempting to meet those expectations, and architectures to facilitate the development and adoption of discovery tools.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speakers reenforced that users want searching to be easy and fast. Dinah Sanders of III noted how this process of finding information has become increasingly iterative, with users expecting to refine their queries. Vinod Chachra of VTLS described that this is why search results must be returned quickly: it allows humans to be seamlessly involved in the discernment process, scanning and instantaneously determining relevancy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Sandusky of the University of Illinois at Chicago, Cameilia Csora of 2collab.com, Karen Hawkins of scitopio.org, Dinah, and Peter Murray of OhioLINK, all showed tools that incorporate at least some now-common web elements to meet these user-expectations, including faceted results, tagging, tag-clouds, and feeds.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many new discovery tools offer truly laudable interface-improvements over previous displays of information, but suffer from a significant architectural limitation: If a tool assumes the only end-user experience is the tool&#x27;s default web-page, opportunities for discovery are drastically limited. For example, if we at Brown were to license the III Encore tool, and a user were to land on one of our &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.brown.edu&#x2F;cds&#x2F;napoleon&#x2F;&quot;&gt;&#x27;Napoleonic Satires&#x27;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; collection pages, it would be wonderful to be able to query an Encore API on &#x27;Napoleon&#x27; to display in a sidebar the terrific discovery data this tool can access. But this and many other discovery tools offer no such API. Fortunately this is changing, with some vendors updating their business models to meet current library discovery needs both deeply and broadly. Ex Libris&#x27; &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com&#x2F;MetaLib&#x2F;Knowledge_Articles&#x2F;Documentation_on_X-server_MetaLib_Version_3.13_and_Higher&quot;&gt;XServer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; licensing is a prime example, offering API functionality to its federated-searching tool, dramatically broadening discovery possibilities beyond the default MetaLib web interface.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentations that touched on system-design and architectural issues to improve discovery were particularly inspiring. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Akerman of NRC CISTI noted that we should utilize our power as information-producers to produce data that more easily lends itself to machine-harvesting. This can be done by encoding data where possible utilizing existing standards such as &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Openurl&quot;&gt;OpenURL&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;COinS&quot;&gt;COinS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, as well as emerging de-facto standards such as &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Microformats&quot;&gt;microformats&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. He showed as one example information displayed in a useful time-line format by a site that had queried data from a harvester site -- possible because of standardized structured date-fields.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Teets of OCLC gave a presentation on OCLC&#x27;s emerging &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;worldcat.org&#x2F;devnet&#x2F;blog&#x2F;presentations&#x2F;2008_01_ALA_Grid_Intro.pdf&quot;&gt;WorldCat Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; services, offering possibilities for cross-referencing standard identifiers such as ISBNs and OCLC numbers, and emerging identifiers such as &#x27;identities&#x27; -- truly a developer&#x27;s dream.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vinod offered numerous useful suggestions for designing systems to minimize user confusion and maximize utility. He showed an example of a site that had both a facet category of LC Subject Headings, and another facet category of Dewey Subject Headings, and the ease with which a user could be confused by this explicit display of overlapping information, hindering rather than helping discovery. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Winkler of the University of Pennsylvania discussed how &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tags.library.upenn.edu&#x2F;help&#x2F;&quot;&gt;PennTags&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is emblematic of an architectural approach the UPenn Library has found successful. His talk brought together multiple threads of this NISO Forum by showing how PennTags offers discovery possibilities in multiple different settings because it is designed as what he called a &#x27;horizontal&#x27; service, as opposed to a &#x27;vertical&#x27; service. The &#x27;vertical&#x27; service paradigm in Winkler&#x27;s view is exactly the one I described earlier as architecturally limited: much useful information is gathered together and funneled down into one website with no possibilities for alternate exposure of the gathered and massaged data. PennTags, he noted, is an example of the &#x27;horizontal&#x27; service paradigm that he sees as the future of UPenn Library discovery software and good discovery software in general. It is not tied to any particular existing service: not the catalog, not electronic resources, not their course-software -- and yet can be used with any of these services -- and in any given context can expose interesting data from another context. Each PennTag entry is exposed as an RSS feed which illustrates the power of simple standards to enhance discovery. In fact, this shift to a horizontal paradigm is so central to the UPenn Library&#x27;s current and future work, that Winkler noted he toyed with re-titling his presentation to something like &#x27;Not PennTags, but Why&#x27;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Mark Ockerbloom, also of the University of Pennsylvania, followed with an update on the DLF&#x27;s &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;code4lib.org&#x2F;conference&#x2F;2008&#x2F;lynema&quot;&gt;&#x27;ILS Discovery Interface Task Force&#x27;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, of which he is the Chair. The task force is set to soon release a standard for ILS discovery services -- in other words, it will set a lightweight API standard for the OPAC layer of the ILS. In the context of this forum, this standard should help foster the shift of the OPAC from a vertical silo-service to a horizontal more flexible one, increasing opportunities for discovery of the underlying OPAC data.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to see the next Forum in this &#x27;Discovery&#x27; series showcase more tools that utilize Winkler&#x27;s horizontal-service architecture concept that increases discovery possibilities. Kudos to NISO for providing another thought-provoking Forum packed with inspirational examples and ideas and conversation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links to presentations should be available soon from the NISO &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.niso.org&#x2F;events&#x2F;2008&#x2F;03&#x2F;next-generation-discovery-tools-new-tools-aging-standards&quot;&gt;event website&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently organized a meeting to brainstorm about what kinds of cool library things we could do if we knew more about a user&#x27;s context. I also put up a &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20100711222621&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.brown.edu&#x2F;confluence&#x2F;display&#x2F;library&#x2F;User-context+brainstorming&quot;&gt;wiki-page&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for the brainstorming process.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This stems from a requirement for a project: I had to be able to access a particular barcode related to a user. Turned out the only way of getting at this barcode was to first get another piece of information, and then use that first piece of information to call an API that returns a bunch of info about a user, including the barcode. Fine; did that; got the barcode and used it for a tunneler I built. I then went to the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20130113222506&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;access2007.uvic.ca&#x2F;?p=32&quot;&gt;Access 2007 conference&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a wonderful library programming&#x2F;technology conference, where, among other terrific presentations, I heard Mark Leggot speak[*] about the repository &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;loomware.typepad.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Repository_Redux_PubVersion.pdf&quot;&gt;presentation-PDF&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; he set up at the University of Prince Edward Island (UPEI). He mentioned the importance of understanding a user&#x27;s &#x27;context&#x27;. Something clicked, and the general implications of what our team had achieved by being able to tie a user&#x27;s log-in to this API-info about the user became clear.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is nothing new in the internet business world; Amazon has been trailblazing this path for years. But given that authentication has mostly been a simple &#x27;boolean&#x27; system in our Library webapps of just determining whether or not a user is permitted to access a site -- this opens up worlds of exciting possibilities. Already we&#x27;ve implemented a proof-of-concept &#x27;drop box&#x27; that determines, from login, the user&#x27;s &#x27;type&#x27; (faculty&#x2F;staff&#x2F;student) and department and uses this data to customize the page displayed after login. Exciting stuff!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
