I found this cool, both the good explanation, and the function and concept... I was reading some documentation on a feature of [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) (a static-site-generator) that auto-creates an [elasticlunr](http://elasticlunr.com/) search index, The docs note that though the index is auto-created, Zola doesn't supply any javascript to actually use it, but the docs show an [example js file](https://github.com/getzola/zola/blob/master/docs/static/search.js) that uses the index.

Looking at that example file, I was curious about what one function was doing...

```js
function debounce(func, wait) {
  var timeout;

  return function () {
    var context = this;
    var args = arguments;
    clearTimeout(timeout);

    timeout = setTimeout(function () {
      timeout = null;
      func.apply(context, args);
    }, wait);
  };
}
```

 ...and had [chatgpt explain it](https://chat.openai.com/share/3cfc2b7e-9d68-4a99-8ef5-6be3c58ec1a8). The main explanatory blurb:  _"The function provided is a common utility function called debounce. This function is used to limit the rate at which a function gets invoked. It's especially useful in scenarios where events might fire more frequently than you'd want, such as when resizing a window or detecting keystrokes in an input box."_
