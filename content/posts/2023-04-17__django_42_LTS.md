Django released a new long-term-support version. 

[This repo](https://github.com/birkin/django_template_42_project) serves as a template for new projects. 

It contains `error_check()` and `version()` [view functions](https://github.com/birkin/django_template_42_project/blob/166a0393f1c311433fd2738404635364c6202135/x_app/views.py#L29-L55). The first makes it easy to test that admins will be emailed on errors. The second helpfully shows the branch and commit in-use (as well as exercises logging).
